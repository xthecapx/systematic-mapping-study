   abstract = {BACKGROUND:  A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE:  We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD:  We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS:  We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS:  Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

Besides, measurement is well known as a key factor for assessing, and improving if needed, the quality of any model in terms of, for instance, its understandability. The easier to understand a model is, the easier to maintain, reuse, etc. In this work, we present the definition of a set of metrics for assessing the understandability of quantum circuits. Some examples of the calculation of the metrics are also presented.

Architecture evaluation aims at showing and providing confidence that design decisions contribute to fulfilling the stakeholder concerns. Some architecture evaluation methods are scenario-based and aim at balancing many potentially conflicting quality attributes. Other works focus on a specific quality attribute and provide metrics to measure it.In this paper we survey the state of the art in metrics for evaluating quality attributes of architectures. The elicited metrics are organized into a catalog, which associates them with the specific quality attributes they aim to measure. We contribute also an MDE framework that generates web views facilitating the analysis of architectures.

   abstract = {Abstract Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging paradigm with the potential to offer significant computational advantage over conventional classical computing by exploiting quantum-mechanical principles such as entanglement and superposition. It is anticipated that this computational advantage of QC will help to solve many complex and computationally intractable problems in several application domains such as drug design, data science, clean energy, finance, industrial chemical development, secure communications, and quantum chemistry. In recent years, tremendous progress in both quantum hardware development and quantum software/algorithm has brought QC much closer to reality. Indeed, the demonstration of quantum supremacy marks a significant milestone in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era—the next logical step being the quantum advantage whereby quantum computers solve a real-world problem much more efficiently than classical computing. As the quantum devices are expected to steadily scale up in the next few years, quantum decoherence and qubit interconnectivity are two of the major challenges to achieve quantum advantage in the NISQ era. QC is a highly topical and fast-moving field of research with significant ongoing progress in all facets. A systematic review of the existing literature on QC will be invaluable to understand the state-of-the-art of this emerging field and identify open challenges for the QC community to address in the coming years. This article presents a comprehensive review of QC literature and proposes taxonomy of QC. The proposed taxonomy is used to map various related studies to identify the research gaps. A detailed overview of quantum software tools and technologies, post-quantum cryptography, and quantum computer hardware development captures the current state-of-the-art in the respective areas. The article identifies and highlights various open challenges and promising future directions for research and innovation in QC.},

   abstract = {We have ubiquitous presence of computers today, ranging from simple controllers in modern appliances to smartphones in our pockets that provide a wide range of everyday services, to powerful supercomputers and large data centers that carry out the most computationally intensive tasks. These computational machines have a few things in common: for example, the information they handle is stored in bits (0 or 1), and the procedure for processing the information is specified by a program. A great deal is known about the limits of what such computational machines can and cannot do efficiently. There are many important computational problems that are believed to be very difficult to solve using even the most powerful computers, where the resource requirement-whether it is the size of the machine or the time it takes to finish the task-increases exponentially as a function of the problem size. It was recognized in the 1980s, first by a group of physicists, that the rules of representing and processing information in modern computers are restricted Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2884353 by the laws of classical physics, which govern the behavior of traditional computational machines (thus the term "classical computer"). The applicable laws of physics were expanded greatly in the 20th century with the development of quantum physics that successfully describes the behavior of systems at the atomic and subatomic levels, which classical physics fails to explain. A natural question that arises is whether more computational power can be gained if the laws of quantum physics are exploited, especially in light of realizing that computational resources required to capture the full behavior of quantum systems appear to increase exponentially as the system size grows. Over the last three decades, our understanding of the computational machines that operate on quantum principles (thus the term "quantum com-puters") has expanded drastically , as the efforts to realize such an exotic computer have made steady yet remarkable progress.

@article{Biamonte2017,
   abstract = {L ong before we possessed computers, human beings strove to find patterns in data. Ptolemy fitted observations of the motions of the stars to a geocentric model of the cosmos, with complex epicycles to explain the retrograde motions of the planets. In the sixteenth century, Kepler analysed the data of Copernicus and Brahe to reveal a previously hidden pattern: planets move in ellipses with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. The analysis of astronomical data to reveal such patterns gave rise to mathematical techniques such as methods for solving linear equations (Newton-Gauss), learning optima via gradient descent (Newton), polynomial interpolation (Lagrange), and least-squares fitting (Laplace). The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries gave rise to a broad range of mathematical methods for analysing data to reveal the patterns that it contained. The construction of digital computers in the mid-twentieth century allowed the automation of data analysis techniques. Over the past half-century, the rapid progression of computer power has allowed the implementation of linear algebraic data analysis techniques such as regression and principal component analysis, and has led to more complex learning methods such as support vector machines. Over the same time frame, the development and rapid advance of digital computers spawned novel machine learning methods. Artificial neural networks such as perceptrons were implemented in the 1950s (ref. 1), as soon as computers had the power to realize them. Deep learning built on neural networks (such as Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines) and training methods (such as back propagation) were introduced and implemented in the 1960s to 1990s (ref. 2). In the past decade, particularly in the past five years, the combination of powerful computers and special-purpose information processors capable of implementing deep networks with billions of weights 3 , together with their application to very large datasets, has revealed that such deep learning networks are capable of identifying complex and subtle patterns in data. Quantum mechanics is well known to produce atypical patterns in data. Classical machine learning methods such as deep neural networks frequently have the feature that they can both recognize statistical patterns in data and produce data that possess the same statistical patterns: they recognize the patterns that they produce. This observation suggests the following hope. If small quantum information processors can produce statistical patterns that are computationally difficult for a classical computer to produce, then perhaps they can also recognize patterns that are equally difficult to recognize classically. The realization of this hope depends on whether efficient quantum algorithms can be found for machine learning. A quantum algorithm is a set of instructions solving a problem, such as determining whether two graphs are isomorphic, that can be performed on a quantum computer. Quantum machine learning software makes use of quantum algorithms as part of a larger implementation. By analysing the steps that quantum algorithms prescribe, it becomes clear that they have the potential to out-perform classical algorithms for specific problems (that is, reduce the number of steps required). This potential is known as quantum speedup. The notion of a quantum speedup depends on whether one takes a formal computer science perspective-which demands mathematical proofs-or a perspective based on what can be done with realistic, finite-size devices-which requires solid statistical evidence of a scaling advantage over some finite range of problem sizes. For the case of quantum machine learning, the best possible performance of classical algorithms is not always known. This is similar to the case of Shor's polynomial-time quantum algorithm for integer factorization: no sub-exponential-time classical algorithm has been found, but the possibility is not provably ruled out. Determination of a scaling advantage contrasting quantum and classical machine learning would rely on the existence of a quantum computer and is called a 'benchmarking' problem. Such advantages could include improved classification accuracy and sampling of classically inaccessible systems. Accordingly, quantum speedups in machine learning are currently characterized using idealized measures from complexity theory: query complexity and gate complexity (see Box 1 and Box 1 Table). Query complexity measures the number of queries to the information source for the classical or quantum algorithm. A quantum speedup results if the number of queries needed to solve a problem is lower for the quantum algorithm than for the classical algorithm. To determine the gate complexity, the number of elementary quantum operations (or gates) required to obtain the desired result are counted. Query and gate complexity are idealized models that quantify the necessary resources to solve a problem class. Without knowing how to map this idealization to reality, not much can be said about the necessary resource scaling in a real-world scenario. Therefore, the required resources of classical machine learning algorithms are mostly quantified by numerical experimentation. The resource requirements of quantum machine learning algorithms are likely to be similarly difficult to quantify in practice. The analysis of their practical feasibility is a central subject of this review. As will be seen throughout the review, there are quantum algorithms for machine learning that exhibit quantum speedups 4-7. For example, the Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data. Quantum systems produce atypical patterns that classical systems are thought not to produce efficiently, so it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement quantum software that could enable machine learning that is faster than that of classical computers. Recent work has produced quantum algorithms that could act as the building blocks of machine learning programs, but the hardware and software challenges are still considerable.},

   abstract = {Shor's factoring algorithm is one of the most anticipated applications of quantum computing. However, the limited capabilities of today's quantum computers only permit a study of Shor's algorithm for very small numbers. Here we show how large GPU-based supercomputers can be used to assess the performance of Shor's algorithm for numbers that are out of reach for current and near-term quantum hardware. First, we study Shor's original factoring algorithm. While theoretical bounds suggest success probabilities of only 3-4 %, we find average success probabilities above 50 %, due to a high frequency of "lucky" cases, defined as successful factorizations despite unmet sufficient conditions. Second, we investigate a powerful post-processing procedure, by which the success probability can be brought arbitrarily close to one, with only a single run of Shor's quantum algorithm. Finally, we study the effectiveness of this post-processing procedure in the presence of typical errors in quantum processing hardware. We find that the quantum factoring algorithm exhibits a particular form of universality and resilience against the different types of errors. The largest semiprime that we have factored by executing Shor's algorithm on a GPU-based supercom-puter, without exploiting prior knowledge of the solution, is 549755813701 = 712321 × 771781. We put forward the challenge of factoring, without oversimplification, a non-trivial semiprime larger than this number on any quantum computing device.},

Long lifetimes can be achieved for material qubit carriers as memories2, at least in principle, but not for propagating photons that are rapidly lost by absorption, diffraction or scattering3. The loss problem can be mitigated with a nondestructive photonic qubit detector that heralds the photon without destroying the encoded qubit. Such a detector is envisioned to facilitate protocols in which distributed tasks depend on the successful dissemination of photonic qubits4,5, improve loss-sensitive qubit measurements6,7 and enable certain quantum key distribution attacks8. Here we demonstrate such a detector based on a single atom in two crossed fibre-based optical resonators, one for qubit-insensitive atom–photon coupling and the other for atomic-state detection9. We achieve a nondestructive detection efficiency upon qubit survival of 79±3 percent and a photon survival probability of 31 ± 1 percent, and we preserve the qubit information with a fidelity of 96.2 ± 0.3 percent. To illustrate the potential of our detector, we show that it can, with the current parameters, improve the rate and fidelity of long-distance entanglement and quantum state distribution compared to previous methods, provide resource optimization via qubit amplification and enable detection-loophole-free Bell tests.}, number={7851}, journal={Nature}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Niemietz, Dominik and Farrera, Pau and Langenfeld, Stefan and Rempe, Gerhard}, year={2021}, month=mar, pages={570–574}, language={en} }

In particular, spin-based qubits in solid-state form factors are attractive as they could potentially benefit from processes similar to those used for conventional semiconductor processing. However, material control is a significant challenge for solid-state spin qubits as residual spins from substrate, dielectric, electrodes, or contaminants from processing contribute to spin decoherence. In the recent decade, valleytronics has seen a revival due to the discovery of valley-coupled spins in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Such valley-coupled spins are protected by inversion asymmetry and time reversal symmetry and are promising candidates for robust qubits. In this report, the progress toward building such qubits is presented. Following an introduction to the key attractions in fabricating such qubits, an up-to-date brief is provided for the status of each key step, highlighting advancements made and/or outstanding work to be done.

   abstract = {Quantum Computing is becoming an increasingly mature area, with a simultaneous escalation of investment in many sectors. Quantum technology will revolutionize all the engineering fields. For example, companies will need to add quantum computing progressively to some or all of their daily operations. It is clear that all existing classical information systems cannot be done away with. Rather than that occurring, it is expected that some quantum algorithms will be added, so that they can work alongside classical information systems. There has been no systematic solution offered to deal with this challenge so far. This research proposes a software modernization approach (model-driven reengineering) designed to restructure classical systems to work in conjunction with quantum systems, thereby providing target environments that combine both of these computational paradigms. The approach proposed is systematic, and based on existing software engineering standards like the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel and the Unified Modelling Language. It could therefore be applied in industry in a way that complies with the existing software evolution processes. The independence of this proposal with respect to quantum programming environments is also guaranteed, making its application feasible in the changing environment in today's quantum industry. The main implication of this approach is technical, but also economic, since it enables the reuse of the knowledge embedded in legacy systems, while at the same time the new quantum-based projects are speeded up.},

There are many different quantum circuit decompositions for the same algorithm but it is desirable to compile leaner circuits. A fundamentally important cost metric is the T count—the number of T gates in a circuit. For the single qubit case, optimal compiling is essentially a solved problem. However, multi-qubit compiling is a harder problem with optimal algorithms requiring classical runtime exponential in the number of qubits. Here, we present and compare several efficient quantum compilers for multi-qubit Clifford + T circuits. We implemented our compilers in C++ and benchmarked them on random circuits, from which we determine that our TODD compiler yields the lowest T counts on average. We also benchmarked TODD on a library of reversible logic circuits that appear in quantum algorithms and found that it reduced the T count for 97% of the circuits with an average T-count saving of 20% when compared against the best of all previous circuit decompositions.}, number={1}, journal={Quantum Science and Technology}, publisher={IOP Publishing}, author={Heyfron, Luke E. and Campbell, Earl T.}, year={2018}, month=sep, pages={015004}, language={en} }

However, the QSVT circuit typically involves multiple ancilla qubits and multi-qubit control gates. In order to simulate a certain class of n-qubit random Hamiltonians, we propose a drastically simplified quantum circuit that we refer to as the minimal QSVT circuit, which uses only one ancilla qubit and no multi-qubit controlled gates. We formulate a simple metric called the quantum unitary evolution score (QUES), which is a scalable quantum benchmark and can be verified without any need for classical computation. Under the globally depolarized noise model, we demonstrate that QUES is directly related to the circuit fidelity, and the potential classical hardness of an associated quantum circuit sampling problem. Under the same assumption, theoretical analysis suggests there exists an ‘optimal’ simulation time topt ≈ 4.81, at which even a noisy quantum device may be sufficient to demonstrate the potential classical hardness.}, number={1}, journal={npj Quantum Information}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Dong, Yulong and Whaley, K.

   abstract = {Quantum computing systems rely on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform a multitude of computationally challenging tasks more efficiently than their classical counterparts. The architecture of software-intensive systems can empower architects who can leverage architecture-centric processes, practices, description languages to model, develop, and evolve quantum computing software (quantum software for short) at higher abstraction levels. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the SLR indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process. Results of this SLR can facilitate researchers and practitioners to develop new hypotheses to be tested, derive reference architectures, and leverage architecture-centric principles and practices to engineer emerging and next generations of quantum software.},

The number of physical qubits; 2. The number of gates that can be applied before errors make the device behave essentially classically; 3. The connectivity of the device; 4.

In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software.

Designing architectures that exhibit a good trade-off between multiple quality attributes is challenging, especially in the case of self-adaptive software systems, due to the complexity, heterogeneity, and ultra-large scale of modern software systems. This challenge increases with the dynamic, open, and uncertain operating environment, as well as the need for complying to environmental, regulatory, and sustainability requirements; such as energy consumption regulations. This study aims at analyzing the research landscape that have explicitly addressed trade-offs management for self-adaptive software architectures, to obtain a comprehensive overview on the current state of research on this specialized area. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze research works related to analyzing and managing trade-offs to support decision-making for self-adaptive software architectures. Twenty primary studies were evidently selected and analyzed to classify software paradigms, quality attributes considered, and the self-* properties that drive trade-offs management. The results show constant interest in finding solutions for trade-offs management at design-time and run-time, as well as the success of research initiatives even when new research challenges are found. The findings call for foundational framework to analyze and manage trade-offs for self-adaptive software architectures that can explicitly consider specific multiple quality attributes, the run-time dynamics, the uncertainty of the environment and the complex challenges of modern, ultra-large scale systems in particular given software paradigms.},

Thus, it is perfectly feasible that during the next few years hybrid systems will start to appear integrating both the classical software systems of companies and new quantum ones providing solutions to problems that still remain unmanageable today. A natural way to support such integration is Service-Oriented Computing. While conceptually the invocation of a quantum software service is similar to that of a classical one, technically there are many differences and technological limitations, which refer to platform independence, decoupling, scalability, etc. To highlight these differences and the difficulties to develop quality quantum services, this paper takes a well-known problem to which a quantum solution can be provided, integer factorization, making use of the Amazon Braket quantum service platform. The exercise of trying to provide the factorization as a quantum service is carried out following the best practices, design patterns and standards existing in the implementation of classical services. This case study is used to highlight the rough edges and limitations that arise in the integration of classical-quantum hybrid systems using service-oriented computing. The conclusion of the study allows us to point out directions in which to focus research efforts in order to achieve effective quantum service-oriented computing.},

   abstract = {Practical quantum computing is rapidly becoming a reality. To harness quantum computers' real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying, deletion, the transmission of qubit states, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software. Thus, developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective, resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs, ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software, iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs, and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities. We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing. Except for performance and scalability, most of the other QAs (e.g., maintainability, testability, and reliability) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a QCP.},

   abstract = {Current quantum systems have significant limitations affecting the processing of large datasets with high dimensionality, typical of high energy physics. In the present paper, feature and data prototype selection techniques were studied to tackle this challenge. A grid search was performed and quantum machine learning models were trained and benchmarked against classical shallow machine learning methods, trained both in the reduced and the complete datasets. The performance of the quantum algorithms was found to be comparable to the classical ones, even when using large datasets. Sequential Backward Selection and Principal Component Analysis techniques were used for feature's selection and while the former can produce the better quantum machine learning models in specific cases, it is more unstable. Additionally, we show that such variability in the results is caused by the use of discrete variables, highlighting the suitability of Principal Component analysis transformed data for quantum machine learning applications in the high energy physics context.},

Quantum computing may bring a leap in computing power and become a 'trigger' and 'catalyst' to accelerate the development of science and technology innovation, and its technical development trend and application prospects have become a hot issue of concern, and quantum simulators are a very important part of the development process. The development of quantum simulators is a very important part of the process. However, due to the lack of systematic evaluation theories and methods, it is difficult to quantify and analyze the quality of the increasing number of simulators on the market, which may hinder researchers from practicing their quantum algorithms objectively or developing quantum technologies. For these reasons, this paper proposes a quality model for quantum simulator software, which reflects the quality characteristics of simulators in seven aspects, such as functionality and performance efficiency, and selects some simulators for experimental validation of the proposed model to prove its rationality.},

   abstract = {The public access to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers facilitated by IBM, Rigetti, D - Wave, etc., has propelled the development of quantum applications that may offer quantum supremacy in the future large-scale quantum computers. Parameterized quantum circuits (P QC) have emerged as a major driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the circuit's resilience to the noise. PQC's have been applied in both generative (e.g. generative adversarial network) and discriminative (e.g. quantum classifier) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning. PQC's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a P QC are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware. However, temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a P QC. Therefore, the circuit that is trained without considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time. In this paper, we present training methodologies for P QC in a completely classical environment that can improve the fidelity of the trained P QC on a target NISQ hardware by as much as 21.91%.},

The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for doing systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).}, journal={Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering}, author={Petersen, Kai and Feldt, Robert and Mujtaba, Shahid and Mattsson, Michael}, year={2008}, month=jun }

After presenting mathematical techniques frequently used in quantum information theory and some basic ideas from quantum mechanics, the author describes quantum gates, circuits, algorithms, and error-correcting codes. He also explores the significance and applications of two unique quantum communication schemes: quantum teleportation and superdense coding. The book concludes with various aspects of quantum cryptography.

But suppose that at our disposal we have several copies of a photon in an unknown state. Is it possible to delete the information content of one or more of these photons by a physical process? Specifically, if two photons are in the same initial polarization state, is there a mechanism that produces one photon in the same initial state and the other in some standard polarization state? If this could be done, then one would create a standard blank state onto which one could copy an unknown state approximately, by deterministic cloning3,4 or exactly, by probabilistic cloning5,6. This could in principle be useful in quantum computation, where one could store new information in an already computed state by deleting the old information. Here we show, however, that the linearity of quantum theory does not allow us to delete a copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly.

However, this development creates a gap in current computer science curricula since most quantum computing lectures are strongly physics-oriented and have little intersection with the remaining curriculum of computer science. This fact makes designing an appealing course very difﬁcult, in particular for non-physicists. Furthermore, in the academic community, there is consensus that quantum computers are going to be used only for speciﬁc computational tasks (e.g., in computational science), where hybrid systems - combined classical and quantum computers - facilitate the execution of an application on both quantum and classical computing resources. A hybrid system thus executes only certain suitable parts of an application on the quantum machine, while other parts are executed on the classical components of the system. To fully exploit the capabilities of hybrid systems and to meet future requirements in this emerging ﬁeld, we need to prepare a new generation of computer scientists with skills in both distributed computing and quantum computing. To bridge this existing gap in standard computer science curricula, we designed a new lecture and exercise series on Hybrid Quantum-Classical Systems, where students learn how to decompose applications and implement computational tasks on a hybrid quantum-classical computational continuum. While learning the inherent concepts underlying quantum systems, students are obligated to apply techniques and methods they are already familiar with, making the entrance to the ﬁeld of quantum computing comprehensive yet appealing and accessible to students of computer science.}, booktitle={2024 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid)}, publisher={IEEE}, author={De Maio, Vincenzo and Kanatbekova, Meerzhan and Zilk, Felix and Friis, Nicolai and Guggemos, Tobias and Brandic, Ivona}, year={2024}, month=may, pages={626–635}, language={en} }

Methods: A process is presented for improving the generation, deployment, and quality assessment of quantum services using an extended OpenAPI Specification and the SonarQube tool. This process also integrates the automatic generation of code for the IBM Quantum provider and its deployment in containers ready for user consumption.
Results: After a detailed and individualized evaluation of the 40 implementations of quantum algorithms using the developed environment, the results reveal significant variability in the analyzability of the algorithms. This will serve in the future as a reference and guide for the continuous improvement of quantum algorithms in terms of their performance and efficiency in solving complex problems in various quantum application areas.
Conclusions: This research offers a fundamental contribution to the evolution of quantum computing by introducing a comprehensive framework for quantum software quality assurance. The proposed approach not only addresses some of the existing problems in quantum software, but also paves the way for the development of quantum algorithms and their servitization.}, journal={Information and Software Technology}, author={Díaz, Ana and Alvarado-Valiente, Jaime and Romero-Álvarez, Javier and Moguel, Enrique and Garcia-Alonso, Jose and Rodríguez, Moisés and García-Rodríguez, Ignacio and Murillo, Juan M.}, year={2024}, month=mar, pages={107643}, language={en} }
