Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect between most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the capabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in the near future. In this contribution to the focus collection 'What would you do with 1000 qubits?', we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks that could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such as generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also highlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key challenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum devices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well from this hybrid quantum-classical framework.",quantum-assisted machine learning; quantum machine learning; near-term quantum computers; hybrid algorithms; unsupervised learning; quantum annealing; unsupervised generative models,"[Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro; Benedetti, Marcello; Realpe-Gomez, John; Biswas, Rupak] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro; Benedetti, Marcello] USRA Res Inst Adv Comp Sci, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro] Qubitera LLC, Mountain View, CA 94041 USA; [Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro; Benedetti, Marcello] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro; Benedetti, Marcello] Cambridge Quantum Comp Ltd, Cambridge CB2 1UB, England; [Realpe-Gomez, John] SGT Inc, Greenbelt, MD 20770 USA; [Realpe-Gomez, John] Univ Cartagena, Inst Matemat Aplicadas, Bolivar 130001, Colombia; [Biswas, Rupak] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Explorat Technol Directorate, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA","National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; University of London; University College London; Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies, Inc.

Close parallels exist between VQMC and the emerging hybrid quantum-classical computational paradigm of variational quantum algorithms. VQMC overcomes the curse of dimensionality by performing alternating steps of Monte Carlo sampling from a parametrized quantum state followed by gradient-based optimization. While VQMC has been applied to solve high-dimensional problems, it is known to be difficult to parallelize, primarily owing to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling step. In this work, we explore the scalability of VQMC when autoregressive models, with exact sampling, are used in place of MCMC. This approach can exploit distributed-memory, shared-memory and/or GPU parallelism in the sampling task without any bottlenecks. In particular, we demonstrate GPU-scalability of VQMC for solving up to ten-thousand dimensional combinatorial optimization problems.",variational inference; density estimation; normalizing flows; generative models; neural networks; GPU parallelization,"[Zhao, Tianchen; De, Saibal; Chen, Brian; Veerapaneni, Shravan] Univ Michigan, Dept Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stokes, James] Simons Fdn, Flatiron Inst, New York, NY USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Zhao, TC (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ericolon@umich.edu; saibalde@umich.edu; chenbri@umich.edu; jstokes@flatironinstitute.org; shravan@umich.edu,,"De, Saibal/0000-0003-4691-189X",NSF [DMS-2038030],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Authors gratefully acknowledge support from NSF under grant DMS-2038030.,,31,5,5,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2167-4329,,978-1-4503-8442-1,INT CONF HIGH PERFOR,,,2021,,,,,,,,,,10.1145/3458817.3476219,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3458817.3476219,,,12,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BU8DS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-31,WOS:000946520100088,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software.

As an ideal unconditional secure technique, OTP requires the key rate the same as the information rate. However, comparing with high speed information traffic (Gbps), the key generation rate of QKD is very poor(Kbps). Therefore, in practical QKD networks, it is difficult to support numerous applications and multiple users simultaneously. To address this issue, we argue that it is more practical to provide quality of security instead of OTP in quantum networks. We further propose ASM, an Adaptive Security Selection Mechanism for quantum networks based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In ASM, services can select an appropriate encryption algorithm that satisfies the proper security level and performance metrics under the limit of the key generation rate.

Optical communication networks offer various metrics, including high transmission capacity, efficient anti-interference, minimum transmission loss and robustness, and so on, that offer opportunities for communication networks. To satisfy the optical network demands, effective network resource utilization is essential. Therefore, developing a tool with improved Quality of Transmission (QoT) accuracy in optical networks is necessary. Recently, Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have provided various opportunities to resolve these issues and the deep learning (DL) algorithms offer improved performance over the conventional methods. This paper developed a novel DL-based cognitive QoT prediction model for Quantum optical communication networks. This proposed model predicts the QoT for the QoS (Quality of Service) setup using the DL model with the transmission computation. The proposed model utilized an optimized DL model called CNN-LSTM for the prediction process using the signal and link characteristics as input features. The DL model is trained using the transmission equations. The hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using frog leap optimization to improve the predictive performance. The experimental results highlight the enhanced and improved version of the proposed model, and the results are compared with the conventional systems in terms of performance measures.",Optical networks; Artificial intelligence; Transmission quality; Prediction; Deep learning; Optimization,"[Zeng, Yan] Chengdu Vocat & Tech Coll Ind, Chengdu 610218, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Zeng, Y (corresponding author), Chengdu Vocat & Tech Coll Ind, Chengdu 610218, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",zengyan1210@163.com,,,,,,,52,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0306-8919,1572-817X,,OPT QUANT ELECTRON,Opt.

Parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have emerged as a major driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the circuit's resilience to the noise. PQC's have been applied in both generative (e.g. generative adversarial network) and discriminative (e.g. quantum classifier) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning. PQC's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a PQC are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware. However, temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a PQC. Therefore, the circuit that is trained without considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time.

We evaluate a (1) purely classical, (2) hybrid kernel, and (3) purely quantum classifier for video QoD congestion classification, where congestion is either low, medium or high, using QoD measurements from a real networking test-bed. Findings show that the SVC performs the classification task 4% better in the low congestion state and the kernel method performs 6.1% and 10.1% better for the medium and high congestion states. Empirical evidence suggests that when the SVC is trained on a very low amount of data, the classification accuracy varies significantly depending on the quality of the training data, however, the variance in classification accuracy of quantum models is significantly lower.

Although they showcase the great achievements of QKD, many practical difficulties still need to be resolved. Inspired by the significant similarity between mobile ad-hoc networks and QKD technology, we propose a novel quality of service (QoS) model including new metrics for determining the states of public and quantum channels as well as a comprehensive metric of the QKD link. We also propose a novel routing protocol to achieve high-level scalability and minimize consumption of cryptographic keys.

The MOCVD growth parameter space was analyzed utilizing two orthogonal metrics which allows comparing and optimizing growth conditions over a wide range of process parameters: effective gas speed, S*, and effective V/III ratio, V/III*. Optimized growth conditions with high V/III, low gas speed, and slow growth rates resulted in improved crystal quality, PL emission efficiency, and micron-scale wavelength uniformity. One of the main challenges in green MQWs with high Indium content is the formation of Indium inclusion type defects due to the large lattice mismatch combined with the miscibility gap between GaN and InN. An effective way of eliminating Indium inclusions was demonstrated by introducing a small fraction of H-2 (2.7%) in the gas composition during the growth of high temperature GaN quantum barriers. In addition, the positive effects of employing an InGaN/GaN superlattice (SL) underlayer to crystal quality and micron-scale emission uniformity was demonstrated, which is of special interest for applications such as micro-LEDs.",Green; MQW; InGaN; Micro LEDs; Micro-pixel LEDs; MOCVD; OVMPE; III-N; Photoluminescence; Cathodoluminescence,"[Berkman, Erkan A.; Lee, Soo Min; Ramos, Frank; Tucker, Eric; Arif, Ronald A.; Armour, Eric A.; Papasouliotis, George D.] Veeco Instruments Inc, GaN Technol Grp, Somerset, NJ 08873 USA",,"Berkman, EA (corresponding author), Veeco Instruments Inc, GaN Technol Grp, Somerset, NJ 08873 USA.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,12,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-62841-983-2,PROC SPIE,,,2016,9748,,,,,,,,97480K,10.1117/12.2213309,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2213309,,,7,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Optics; Physics,BF6LF,,,,,2024-03-31,WOS:000383241000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The measurement of the magnetic saturation is one of such methods and it is conventionally employed in the cemented carbides industry. We present a general quantum mechanics based relation between the magnetic saturation and the components of the binder phase of cemented carbides, which can be directly employed as a quality control. To illustrate our results, we calculate the magnetic saturation of a binder phase, 85Ni15Fe binary alloy, using ab-initio methods and compare the theoretical predictions to the magnetic saturation measurements. We also analyse interface and segregation effects on the magnetic saturation by studying the electronic structure of the binder phase. The excellent agreement between calculations and measurements demonstrates the applicability of our method to any binder phase.

However, their applications are substantially limited by the QD quality and/or complicated synthesis. Herein, a facile new synthesis is developed for highly monodisperse and halide passivated PbS QDs. The new synthesis is based on a heterogeneous system containing a PbCl2-Pb(OA)(2) solid-liquid precursor solution. The solid PbCl2 inhibits the diffusion of monomers and maintains a high oversaturation condition for the growth of PbS QDs, resulting in high monodispersities. In addition, the PbCl2 gives rise to halide passivation on the PbS QDs, showing excellent stability in air. The high monodispersity and good passivation endow these PbS QDs with outstanding optoelectronic properties, demonstrated by a 9.43% power conversion efficiency of PbS QD solar cells with a bandgap of similar to 0.95 eV (1,300 nm). We believe that this heterogeneous strategy opens up a new avenue optimizing for the synthesis and applications of QDs.",heterogeneous system synthesis; lead sulfide quantum dots; high monodispersities; halide passivation; infrared solar cells,"[Wang, Bo; Li, Mingyu; Liu, Yuxuan; Liang, Xinyi; Gao, Liang; Tang, Jiang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol HUST, Wuhan Natl Lab Optoelect WNLO, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yang; Lan, Xinzheng; Zhang, Jianbing; Tang, Jiang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol HUST, Sch Opt & Elect Informat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Gao, Liang; Zhang, Jianbing] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wenzhou Adv Mfg Technol Res Inst, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianbing] Shenzhen Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Res Inst, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China; [Tang, Jiang] Opt Valley Lab, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Shenzhen Huazhong University of Science & Technology Research Institute; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Gao, L; Tang, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol HUST, Wuhan Natl Lab Optoelect WNLO, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JB; Tang, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol HUST, Sch Opt & Elect Informat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Gao, L; Zhang, JB (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wenzhou Adv Mfg Technol Res Inst, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JB (corresponding author), Shenzhen Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Res Inst, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China.;Tang, J (corresponding author), Opt Valley Lab, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",highlight@mail.hust.edu.cn; jbzhang@hust.edu.cn; jtang@mail.hust.edu.cn,"liang, xinyi/JFA-6013-2023; Tang, Jiang/G-2654-2012; Wang, Bo/AAS-9260-2021; Li, Ming-Yu/AAH-6879-2020; Liang, xinyi/GLU-4937-2022","Li, Ming-Yu/0000-0003-4812-8604; Liang, xinyi/0000-0002-3315-9742","National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFA0715502, 2021YFA0715500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61974052, 61904065]; Innovation Project of Optics Valley Laboratory [OVL2021BG009]; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality [GJHZ20210705142540010]; Key R&D Program of Hubei Province [2021BAA014]; International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of Hubei Province [2021EHB010]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Project of Optics Valley Laboratory; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; Key R&D Program of Hubei Province; International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of Hubei Province","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Nos. 2021YFA0715502 and 2021YFA0715500), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61974052 and 61904065), the Innovation Project of Optics Valley Laboratory (No. OVL2021BG009), and the Fund from Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality (No. GJHZ20210705142540010), the Key R&D Program of Hubei Province (No. 2021BAA014), and the International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of Hubei Province (No. 2021EHB010).

We present two protocols, which utilize this setup, that can either generate highly entangled two-qubit states over an arbitrary distance or transfer single-qubit states with high fidelity to any desired location on the chain. In addition, we can execute several protocols at the same time and also store quantum states on the spin chain. Our protocols exploit the effect of coherent destruction of tunneling to control, which spins on the chain couple to each other. This control is acquired by suitably shaping the external driving field. The success of our protocols does not depend on the values of the couplings between the spins as long as they are finite and much smaller than the driving frequency.

In our research, to prohibit fluorescence quenching dots which is caused by the connection of the PQDs and hole injection material into the emissive layer and hole injection layer, poly [(9,9- dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4'-(N-(pbutylphenyl)) diphenylamine)] (TFB) is utilized which can decrease the hole injection barrier. As the TFB layer is prepared by a spin-coating setup, the layer can be managed by controlling the concentration of the TFB precursor solution and the rotational speed for spin-coating the TFB solution. Therefore, in this study, we do both of them to reach a high-quality perovskite quantum dot light emitting diode. Also, we fabricate a control device (without a TFB layer) to compare the luminescence results. Results show that for fabricated PQDLEDs, turn-on voltage decreases from 3.01 V (for the device without TFB) to 2.2 V (for the optimized device). Besides, for the best-optimized PQDLED, it is shown that the maximum brightness is about 4550 cd m-2, maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) versus luminance is 0.153%, and maximum current efficiency is about 0.5 cd A-1.",Perovskite; Quantum dot; FA -Doped CsPbBr 3; TFB; Optimization,"[Wang, Yang] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China; [Sun, Minghui] Jilin Univ, Coll Comp Sci &Technol, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China",Southwest Jiaotong University; Jilin University,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China.",yangwang@swjtu.edu.cn,"zhu, zhu/JDN-0159-2023",,National Development and Reform Commission in China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; [Q110522S07001]; [2682020CX77],National Development and Reform Commission in China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); ;,This work is supported by the funding from National Development and Reform Commission in China (grant numbers Q110522S07001) .

In addition to integer quantum Hall effects (IQHEs) of consecutive filling factors from v = 8 down to 1, we also observed the quantum states at filling factors between v = 1 and 2, and between v = 2 and 3 at 1.71 K. The observation of quantum Hall effects at the inferior mobility confirmed the mobility/quality dichotomy in the ultraclean undoped Ge/SiGe heterostructure. The study explicitly indicated that the device fabrication process likely compromised the transport mobility, whereas the quantum quality was less influenced, and established the heterostructure as an ideal platform for quantum device implementations.",BAND-STRUCTURE; MECHANISMS,"[Li, Yi-Xin; Hou, Shimin; Huang, Shaoyun] Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Quantum Devices, Key Lab Phys & Chem Nanodevices, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Kong, Zhenzhen; Wang, Guilei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microelect, Integrated Circuit Adv Proc R&D Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Kong, Zhenzhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Integrated Circuits, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guilei] Hefei Natl Lab, Hefei 230088, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guilei] Beijing Superstring Acad Memory Technol, Beijing 100176, Peoples R China","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Microelectronics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hefei National Laboratory","Wang, GL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microelect, Integrated Circuit Adv Proc R&D Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Wang, GL (corresponding author), Hefei Natl Lab, Hefei 230088, Peoples R China.;Wang, GL (corresponding author), Beijing Superstring Acad Memory Technol, Beijing 100176, Peoples R China.",guilei.wang@bjsamt.org.cn; syhuang@pku.edu.cn,"; Huang, Shaoyun/B-5018-2012","Hou, Shimin/0000-0002-5042-4405; guilei, wang/0000-0002-1311-8863; Huang, Shaoyun/0000-0002-2222-3999","National Natural Science Foundation of China [11974030, 92165208]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [1202010]; Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology [2021ZD0302300]; National Key Research and Development Plan [2016YFA0301701]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2020037]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology; National Key Research and Development Plan; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 11974030 and No. 92165208), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 1202010), the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (Project No. 2021ZD0302300), the National Key Research and Development Plan (Project No. 2016YFA0301701), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS (Project No. 2020037).

These emerging technologies are funded on the size-dependent optical properties of the QDs. Consequently, it is a crucial aspect to get insight into different ways for syntheses of their nanosized particles. In this work, we use two different QD elaboration methods: (i) a single source precursor thermal growth methodology and (ii) a microwave synthetic route. Using both protocols, high quality small QDs (empty set < 5 nm) are produced. Both growing techniques offer the advantage to be simple and fast: 2 hours (i) and less than 25 minutes (ii) in duration, growth temperatures do not exceed 280 degrees C. For both elaboration procedures, we report a unique physics/chemistry cross-disciplinary study on these small size QDs: mass spectrometry (MS) technique provides background data about composition, size and stability of particles; crystalline structure and size distribution of the QDs are obtained from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); room temperature (RT) optical spectrometry of nanodispersions - photoluminescence (PL) and absorption - reveals quantum size effects.

Methods: We employed qualitative methodology that included: 1) Two focus groups (one with patients with PsA and another with non-rheumatologist specialists involved in the care of PsA patients); 2) A narrative literature review of published documents related to the quality of care in PsA; 3) A nominal group meeting in which 15 expert rheumatologists generated and reached a consensus on a series of quality criteria, as well as formulas or quantifiable objective measures to evaluate them; 4) The Delphi method to establish the feasibility, priority and agreement with the quality criteria; 5) A final generation of standards of care and their attributes. A descriptive analysis of the results was carried out. Results: A total of 59 standards of care was generated, 18 of mandatory compliance, grouped into 4 blocks according to specific objectives: 1) early diagnosis (n = 6); 2) optimizing the management of the disease (n= 26); 3) multidisciplinary collaboration (n = 9); 4) monitoring improvement (n=18). To assess compliance with these standards of care, in many cases, the medical records will be reviewed. Other sources will be the records of the service and hospital and bibliographic databases. Regarding the level of compliance, for some of the standards of care this is yes/no; for others, compliance ranges from 50% to 100% and, in this range, in many cases, compliance was 80%.

However, recent experiments on QA-hardware platforms have demonstrated that, in the operating regime corresponding to weak interactions, the QA hardware behaves like a noisy Gibbs sampler at a hardware-specific effective temperature. This work builds on those insights and identifies a class of small hardware-native Ising models that are robust to noise effects and proposes a procedure for executing these models on QA hardware to maximize Gibbssampling performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol results in high-quality Gibbs samples from a hardware-specific effective temperature. Furthermore, we show that this effective temperature can be adjusted by modulating the annealing time and energy scale.

The crystal quality of the grown layers was examined by high -resolution X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. It was found that the incorporation of Sb into Al0462In0.538AsySby-1 is strongly temperature -dependent and reduced growth temperatures are necessary in order to achieve significant Sb mole fractions in the grown layers.

The paper is relevant to the professionalism of actuaries in general, and to those who assess the quantum of damages in particular. Quality framework theories propose that practitioners need to apply a range of technical and normative capabilities to provide a quality professional service. This paper suggests the various capabilities that are needed by actuaries in the field of assessment of the quantum of damages, and orders them by applying a quality framework. A methodology for practitioners to benchmark the quality of their practice is outlined. In South Africa, there is no formal curriculum, canon, or specific guidance for actuaries practising in this field. The paper therefore also contributes to the professionalisation of the field by reviewing and recording relevant literature, and provisionally filling gaps in it from personal experience of the author as practitioner in this field. The paper concludes by suggesting that this approach could also help professionalise other fields of actuarial practice.",Professionalism; professionalisation; professional practice; actuarial quality framework; assessment of quantum of damages; loss of support; loss of earnings,"[Lowther, M.

Therefore, this study developed an intelligent hybrid air-quality forecasting system based on feature selection and a modified evolving interval type-2 quantum fuzzy neural network (eIT2QFNN), which provides accurate air-quality forecasting information by considering climate influencing factors. The main contributions of this study are as follows. The optimal input structure of the model is determined by the proposed second-stage feature-selection model, which can better extract the influencing variables and remove redundant information. Moreover, a novel multi-objective chaotic Bonobo optimizer algorithm is proposed to improve the eIT2QFNN. The modified eIT2QFNN implements AQI prediction by considering the importance of influencing variables that can cope with the uncertainties and fuzziness in the forecasting process. Finally, the Diebold-Mariano and modified Diebold-Mariano tests are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly improves the modeling performance in terms of high accuracy and compact structure, and can thus serve as an effective tool for air-quality management.

Sulfur powder could be dissolved in N-oleoyl-morpholine at room temperature. The kinetics of nucleation/growth was monitored via the temporal evolution of optical properties of the as-prepared CdS quantum dots. Various synthetic parameters were systematically investigated, such as growth temperature of 190 degrees C-260 degrees C, OA concentrations of 1.5 mL-2 mL, and the feed molar ratios of (0.5-3) Cd/1S. With increasing feed molar ratio of Cd/S, little trap emission could be observed. The feed molar ratio of 3Cd/1S was suggested to be the optimal synthetic window, together with the amount of OA 1.5 mL and the growth temperature of 210 degrees C.

However, the random position of self-organized QDs inhibits a deterministic coupling in devices relying on cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) effects which complicates, e.g., the large scale fabrication of quantum light sources. As a result, large efforts focus on the growth and the device integration of site-controlled QDs. We present the growth of low density arrays of site-controlled In(Ga)As QDs where shallow etched nanoholes act as nucleation sites. The nanoholes are located relative to cross markers which allows for a precise spatial alignment of the site-controlled QDs (SCQDs) and the photonic modes of high quality microcavites with an accuracy better than 50 nm. We also address the optical quality of the SCQDs in terms of the single SCQD emission mode linewidth, the oscillator strength and the quantum efficiency. A stacked growth of strain coupled SCQDs forming on wet chemically etched nanoholes provide the smallest linewidth with an average value of 210 mu eV. Using time resolved photoluminescence studies on samples with a varying thickness of the capping layer we determine a quantum efficiency of the SCQD close to 50 % and an oscillator strength of about 10.

Herein, a seed-mediated heat-up approach is developed for the preparation of high-quality core/shell QDs with variable shell composition and continuously tunable shell thickness by selection of conventional salts as the precursors. The method is very simple and highly reproducible and, therefore, can be easily scaled up to get gram-level product. The as-obtained CdSe/CdS and CdSe/ZnCdS core/shell QDs exhibit intriguing optical properties, that is a narrow photoluminescence (PL) emission peak and near-unity PL quantum yield. Importantly, the CdSe/ZnCdS core/shell QDs with a size of 11.4 nm exhibit obviously suppressed blinking behavior, and the fraction of nonblinking QDs (defined by an on-time fraction >= 0.95) can reach as high as 96.0% on the measurement of more than 200 QDs. Moreover, quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) based on CdSe/ZnCdS core/shell QDs show a peak external quantum efficiency of 14.8% and low efficiency roll-off at luminance ranging from 1000 to 25 000 cd center dot m(-2).

However, most of the GQDs synthesized by existing methods face limitations due to the harmful chemicals involved in their synthesis and the presence of various oxygen functional groups, both of which affect the biocompatibility of the GQDs. Here, we present a simple approach to fabricating fluorescent and biocompatible high-quality GQDs with low oxygen content without the involvement of harmful chemicals. High-quality GQDs are synthesized by hydrogen-assisted pyrolysis of silicon carbide and this dry synthesis process allows the GQDs to possess high crystallinity with no unwanted chemicals on the surface. Subsequently, the high-quality GQDs are slightly oxidized through sonication in ethanol, but the treated GQDs (t-GQDs) still retain their high crystallinity. The t-GQDs exhibit strong ultraviolet/blue light emission with a high yield of 30.9%, a phenomenon that can be attributed to intrinsic emission resulting from the low oxygen content of the t-GQDs. Furthermore, the t-GQDs show low cytotoxicity even at a high concentration of 200 mg/mL due to the absence of harmful chemicals during their synthesis and the low oxygen content of the t-GQDs. These results demonstrate the excellence of the t-GQDs and their applicability in bio-fields. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with TOPO, liquid paraffin is cheaper, more friendly to environmentally, and more stable in the air. The effects of the reaction temperature, growth time, precursor concentration, and the quantities of the ligands on the properties of the CdTe QDs were investigated in this paper. This new route reduces the raw material cost and enables us to obtain CdTe QDs with a broad emission spectral ranging from 570 to 720 nm at relatively low temperatures.

In this study, we explored the quality consistent of liquorice from different locations by using multiple fingerprint profiles, including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). In addition, the average method of systematic quantified fingerprint method (AMSQFM) was presented to combine the chemical information of chromatography and spectral fingerprint. Macro qualitative similarity (Sm) and macro quantitative similarity (Pm) were used to assess the quality of 55 samples in terms of both qualitative and quantitative aspects. As a result, all the samples were well differentiated and classified into 6 grades. Additionally, partial least squares (PLS) model was used to evaluate the feasibility of quantizing glycyrrhizic acid (GLA) and liquiritin (LQT) by FT-IR spectral quantized fingerprint. The explanatory ability (R2Y) and prediction ability (Q2) of model were all greater than 0.9 and 0.5 respectively, the root mean square error of estimation (RMSEE) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) were both less than 2.0. In the end, two characteristic parameters of electrochemistry (EC), oscillation life (tosc) and maximum amplitude (Delta Emax), were used to predict the reducibility of liquorice. Models were accurate and had good predictive abilities with the appropriate parameters, five active components in liquorice all exhibited certain reducing ability.

Hence, the band gap energy (E(g)) was found to increase systematically with the decrease in the grain size and ranged from 3.58 to 3.71 eV for the direct and from 3.01 to 3.26 eV for the indirect transitions. This is consistent with the quantum confinement model and, up to now, not observed in a convincing manner in the CeO(2) thin films.

In a recent experiment, the interaction of a superconducting quantum bit with modes of a phononic crystal has been demonstrated. The field of these modes is localized in a compact area, providing high values of the coupling constant with the qubit. However, the Q-factor of phononic crystal modes is strongly limited (similar to 1050) due to a phonon emission from the crystal ends. For further use of phononic crystals in research in the field of quantum acoustodynamics, it is desirable to overcome this limitation in the quality factor. In this work, we have proposed a structure consisting of a phononic crystal placed between the Bragg mirrors. Our simulations predict that the Q-factor in such a structure can reach (similar to 100000). We demonstrate experimental results in which this structure has a Q-factor (similar to 60,000), which is 60 times higher than that of an acoustic crystal of the same size.",Quantum acoustics; Quantum acoustodynamics; Quartz; Piezoelectric; Reflective array method; Quasinormal mode; Superconducting qubit,"[Bolgar, Aleksey N.; Strelnikov, Aleksandr; Astafiev, Oleg, V] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Bolshoy Blvd 30, Moscow 121205, Russia; [Bolgar, Aleksey N.; Sanduleanu, Shtefan, V; Strelnikov, Aleksandr; Astafiev, Oleg, V] Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Lab Artificial Quantum Syst, 9 Inst Skiy Per, Dolgoprudnyi 141700, Moscow Region, Russia; [Sanduleanu, Shtefan, V] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Leninskiy Pereulok 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Astafiev, Oleg, V] Royal Holloway Univ London, Phys Dept, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Astafiev, Oleg, V] Natl Phys Lab, Hampton Rd, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England",Skolkovo Institute of Science & Technology; Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); University of London; Royal Holloway University London; National Physical Laboratory - UK,"Bolgar, AN (corresponding author), Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Bolshoy Blvd 30, Moscow 121205, Russia.;Bolgar, AN (corresponding author), Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Lab Artificial Quantum Syst, 9 Inst Skiy Per, Dolgoprudnyi 141700, Moscow Region, Russia.",alexgood@list.ru,"Sanduleanu, Shtefan/G-3199-2014","Sanduleanu, Shtefan/0000-0002-1520-9857; Bolgar, Aleksey/0000-0001-7559-2336; Astafiev, Oleg/0000-0001-5763-589X",Russian Science Foundation [21-42-00025],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),We acknowledge Russian Science Foundation (Grant No. 21-42-00025) for supporting the work.

The WS is typically pinned by the residual disorder sites and manifests an insulating behavior, with nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) and noise characteristics. We report here measurements on an ultralow-disorder, dilute 2DES, confined to a GaAs quantum well. In the nu < 1=5 range, superimposed on a highly insulating longitudinal resistance, the 2DES exhibits a developing fractional quantum Hall state at nu =1/7, attesting to its exceptional high quality and dominance of electron-electron interaction in the low filling regime. In the nearby insulating phases, we observe remarkable nonlinear I-V and noise characteristics as a function of increasing current, with current thresholds delineating three distinct phases of the WS: a pinned phase (P1) with very small noise, a second phase (P2) in which dV/dI fluctuates between positive and negative values and is accompanied by very high noise, and a third phase (P3) where dV/dI is nearly constant and small, and noise is about an order of magnitude lower than in P2. In the depinned (P2 and P3) phases, the noise spectrum also reveals well-defined peaks at frequencies that vary linearly with the applied current, suggestive of washboard frequencies. We discuss the data in light of a recent theory that proposes different dynamic phases for a driven WS.",INSULATING PHASE; DYNAMICS; FREQUENCY,"[Madathil, P. T.; Rosales, K. A. Villegas; Chung, Y.

Purpose: To investigate the image quality and the optimal strength level of a quantum IR algorithm (QIR; Siemens Healthcare) for virtual monoenergetic images and polychromatic images (T3D) in a phantom and in patients undergoing portal venous abdominal PCD CT. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured in a water-filled phantom. Consecutive oncologic patients who underwent portal venous abdominal PCD CT between March and April 2021 were included. Virtual monoenergetic images at 60 keV and T3D were reconstructed without QIR (QIR-off; reference standard) and with QIR at four levels (QIR 1-4; index tests). Global noise index, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and voxel-wise CT attenuation differences were measured. Noise and texture, artifacts, diagnostic confidence, and overall quality were assessed qualitatively. Conspicuity of hypodense liver lesions was rated by four readers. Parametric (analyses of variance, paired t tests) and nonparametric tests (Friedman, post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were used to compare quantitative and qualitative image quality among reconstructions. Results: In the phantom, NPS showed unchanged noise texture across reconstructions with maximum spatial frequency differences of 0.01 per millimeter. Fifty patients (mean age, 59 years 6 16 [standard deviation]; 31 women) were included. Global noise index was reduced from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 45% for 60 keV and by 44% for T3D (both, P < .001). CNR of the liver improved from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 74% for 60 keV and by 69% for T3D (both, P < .001). No evidence of difference was found in mean attenuation of fat and liver (P =.79-.84) and on a voxel-wise basis among reconstructions. Qualitatively, QIR-4 outperformed all reconstructions in every category for 60 keV and T3D (P value range, <= 001 to.01). All four readers rated QIR-4 superior to other strengths for lesion conspicuity (P value range, <= 001 to.04). Conclusion: In portal venous abdominal photon-counting detector CT, an iterative reconstruction algorithm (QIR; Siemens Healthcare) at high strength levels improved image quality by reducing noise and improving contrast-to-noise ratio and lesion conspicuity without compromising image texture or CT attenuation values.

However, degradation of properties under atmospheric conditions and high-density charge traps in black phosphorus have largely limited its actual mobility thus hindering its future applications. Here, we report the fabrication of stable sandwiched heterostructures by encapsulating atomically thin black phosphorus between hexagonal boron nitride layers to realize ultra-clean interfaces that allow a high field-effect mobility of similar to 1,350 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) at room temperature and on-off ratios exceeding 105. At low temperatures, the mobility even reaches similar to 2,700 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) and quantum oscillations in black phosphorus two-dimensional hole gas are observed at low magnetic fields.

We revealed that the precursor concentration can be scaled up from 0.079 M to 15.8 M (200-fold) while excellent nanocrystal quality is maintained. We found that the size, size distribution, optical properties, and composition of the PbS QDs synthesized with various concentrations show negligible difference. As a result, all the solar cells based on these PbS QDs show excellent performance with stable efficiency in the range of 10% to 10.5%. And the results from carrier recombination, trap density and carrier concentration measurements are consistent with the corresponding photovoltaic performance. More importantly, we proved that the highly concentrated synthesis is a general approach that can be applied to different lead precursors.

Pharmaceutical quality concerns both the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and the Finished Drug Product/ Formulation. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of reports of harmful impurities in marketed drug formulations. Impurities range from solvents, reactants, adulterants, and catalysts to synthetic byproducts. Quality concerns in commercial preparations may also arise due to shelf life stability. Furthermore, a number of falsified and substandard drug cases have been reported. Most of the techniques which are currently in place can, at best, detect the impurities, but cannot identify them unless they are already known and can be compared to a standard. On the other hand, H-1 NMR spectroscopy detects all the hydrogen containing species, typically provides information to elucidate structures partially or even completely, and through its absolute quantitative capabilities even can detect the presence hydrogen-free species indirectly. The structural properties that produce H-1 NMR signals as characteristic representations of a given molecule are the chemical shifts (delta in ppm) and coupling constants (J in Hz). Along with the line widths (omega(1/2) in Hz), these parameters are bound to both the molecule and the NMR experimental conditions by quantum mechanical (QM) principles. This means that the H-1 NMR spectra of APIs can be precisely calculated and compared to the experimental data. This review explains how H-1 NMR spectroscopy coupled with Full Spin Analysis can contribute towards the quality control of pharmaceuticals by improving structural dereplication and achieving simultaneous quantification of both APIs and their contaminants.

The vastness of the chemical space makes approaches using building blocks challenging. The most common approach is therefore an individual parametrization of each compound by deriving partial charges from semiempirical or ab initio calculations and inheriting the bonded and van der Waals (Lennard-Jones) parameters from a (bio)molecular force field. The quality of the partial charges generated in this fashion depends on the level of the quantum-chemical calculation as well as on the extraction procedure used. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based approach for predicting partial charges extracted from density functional theory (DFT) electron densities. The training set was chosen with the goal to provide a broad coverage of the known chemical space of druglike molecules. In addition to the speed of the approach, the partial charges predicted by ML are not dependent on the three-dimensional conformation in contrast to the ones obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP). To assess the quality and compatibility with standard force fields, we performed benchmark calculations for the free energy of hydration and liquid properties such as density and heat of vaporization.",MOLECULAR-FORCE FIELD; HYDRATION FREE-ENERGIES; ATOMIC CHARGES; POPULATION ANALYSIS; BASIS-SETS; DENSITY; PARAMETERS; COSMO; SIMULATIONS; SOLVATION,"[Bleiziffer, Patrick; Schaller, Kay; Riniker, Sereina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Phys Chem Lab, Vladimir Prelog Weg 2, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Riniker, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Phys Chem Lab, Vladimir Prelog Weg 2, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",sriniker@ethz.ch,"Riniker, Sereina/N-3000-2015","Schaller, Kay/0000-0003-1555-5626",Swiss National Science Foundation [200021-159713]; ETH Zurich [ETH-08 15-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [200021_159713] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The authors thank Andrew Dalke for a modified version of the ChemFp package and Gregory Landrum for useful discussions.

Phase one is the estimation of unintended crosstalk between multiplexed QD-antibody reporters, and phase two is digital correction of this crosstalk. Results show that crosstalk varies among tissues and reagents, and in some cases it can be on the same order of magnitude as the original intended signal. In cases where target protein expression is assumed to be independent, crosstalk can be empirically estimated from imaging data and corrected for.

Recently. a simple Metal-Induced-Lateral-Crystallization (MILC) method with nickel, together with high temperature annealing, can result in single crystal like polysilicon film[1]. TFTs fabricated oil this so-called Large-grain Silicon-On-Insulator (LPSOI) call achieve SOI MOSFET performance especially for making small dimension devices. This paper reports that the polysilicon grain quality can be further enhanced by crystallizing the polysilicon film into the shape of long-wire. The crystallization procedure started with a regular Nickel-Induced-Lateral-Crystallization (NILC) process at 560 degreesC as described in [1]. The film was then etched into narrow wires, which were parallel to the direction of nickel propagation. The NILC second anneal at 900 degreesC was then performed on these silicon wire. Through surface energy anisotropy stimulated grain expansion in the NILC high-temperature second annealing, enhanced grain quality beyond that oil planar polysilicon film. Transistor fabricated on these wire is similar to gate-all-around structure as that of FinFET [2]. Much better scalability to the deep submicron region was observed for these wire transistors than regular planar TFTs formed on the same NILC film. Experimental results showed that a wide transistor formed by the parallel combination of the quantum wire transistors much higher current drive than a TFT on the same NILC film with equivalent width.",,"Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Sai Kung, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Wang, HM (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Sai Kung, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,MATERIALS RESEARCH SOC,WARRENDALE,"506 KEYSTONE DRIVE, WARRENDALE, PA 15088-7563 USA",0272-9172,,1-55899-622-2,MATER RES SOC SYMP P,,,2002,686,,,,,,121,126,,,,,,6,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Materials Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BU95D,,,,,2024-03-31,WOS:000177472500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a precise synthesis of high-quality BPQDs is still a great challenge owing to the formation of an impurity phase when employing traditional methods. Herein, we demonstrate the scalable fabrication of BPQDs from mineralization-derived bulk black phosphorus (BP) single crystals by means of a microwave (MW)-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation method in ethanol. The primary results demonstrate that ethanol plays a crucial role in determining the final properties of BPQDs, such as their excellent tolerance to oxygen, good crystallinity, and uniform size. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the formation of BPQDs is proposed, revealing that a layer-by-layer disintegration process of bulk BP crystals under microwave-energy stimuli is responsible.

We gather from this that the average shifts Delta omega of QDs Raman peaks are reduced compared to those previously observed in graphene and GaAs capped QDs. The encapsulation by graphene makes the indium atomic concentration intact in the QDs by the reduction of the strain effect of graphene on QDs and the migration of In atoms towards the surface.

This is due to their unique excitonic features arising from their 1D quantum confinement. However, existing methods for integrating CQW onto microresonators will cause low laser quality due to uneven CQW coating. To overcome this, the use of liquid-interface kinetically driven self-assembly is proposed to coat ultrathin, close-packed layers of colloidal CdSe/Cd1-xZnxS core/shell CQWs between 7 and 14 nm onto the surface of silica microsphere cavities. The fabricated CQW-whispering-gallery-mode microlasers possess a commendable high quality (Q) factor of 13 000 at room temperature. Stable single-mode lasing output is demonstrated through evanescent field coupling between a CQW-coated microsphere and a thin uncoated microfiber in a 2D-3D microcavity configuration. These promising results highlight the suitability of the liquid-interface kinetically driven self-assembly method for realizing ultrathin CQW-coated microlasers and its high compatibility for integrating colloidal nanocrystals onto complex 3D microstructures for future miniaturized colloidal optoelectronic and photonic applications.",colloidal quantum wells; colloidal semiconductor microlasers; self-assembly; whispering-gallery-mode lasing,"[Thung, Yi Tian; Duan, Rui; Durmusoglu, Emek G.; Xiao, Lian; Lee, Calvin Xiu Xian; Lew, Wen Siang; Demir, Hilmi Volkan; Sun, Handong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Phys & Appl Phys, 21 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Thung, Yi Tian; Durmusoglu, Emek G.; Demir, Hilmi Volkan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Photon Inst, LUMINOUS Ctr Excellence Semicond Lighting & Displa, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [He, Yichen; Zhang, Lin] Tianjin Univ, Sch Precis Instruments & Optoelect Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Demir, Hilmi Volkan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Demir, Hilmi Volkan] Bilkent Univ, UNAM Inst Mat Sci & Nanotechnol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dept Phys, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkiye",Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Tianjin University; Nanyang Technological University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Demir, HV; Sun, HD (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Phys & Appl Phys, 21 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637371, Singapore.;Demir, HV (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Photon Inst, LUMINOUS Ctr Excellence Semicond Lighting & Displa, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.;Demir, HV (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.;Demir, HV (corresponding author), Bilkent Univ, UNAM Inst Mat Sci & Nanotechnol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dept Phys, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkiye.",hvdemir@ntu.edu.sg; hdsun@ntu.edu.sg,"Lew, Wen Siang/C-2910-2008; Demir, Hilmi Volkan/AAV-2194-2020; Sun, Handong/A-2940-2010","Lew, Wen Siang/0000-0002-5161-741X; Demir, Hilmi Volkan/0000-0003-1793-112X; Sun, Handong/0000-0002-2261-7103; DUAN, RUI/0009-0006-9197-5728; Lee, Calvin Xiu Xian/0000-0002-5426-2482; Durmusoglu, Emek G./0000-0001-6840-8342","Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) MTC program [AME-IRG- A20E5c0083]; Ministry of Education, Singapore [MOE-RG62/20]; TUBA; Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) MTC program [M21J9b0085]; EDB-IPP [REQ0165097]","Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) MTC program(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); TUBA(Turkish Academy of Sciences); Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) MTC program(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); EDB-IPP","Y.T.T. and R.D. contributed to this work equally.

Herein, we report a versatile approach to synthesize high-quality CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (sized 5-15 nm) by ligand-assisted reprecipitation at room temperature. The monodispersed CsPbBr3 nanocube perovskites displayed relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields of 50-80%. By virtue of the quantum size effects, the bandgap energies were manipulated from blue to green spectral regions (410-530 nm). In addition, through compositional modulations of the anion exchange technique, the bright photoluminescence could be almost tuned over the entire visible spectral region (450-650 nm). Furthermore, the photoluminescence of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals was characterized by narrow emission line widths of 15-50 nm and radiative lifetimes of 5-15 ns. Finally, by taking advantage of these outstanding merits, the CsPbBr3 perovskites were successfully utilized in the application of highly fluorescent patterning and color-purity light-emitting diodes.",HALIDE PEROVSKITES; ANION-EXCHANGE; CSPBX3; BR; CL; LUMINESCENT; EMISSION; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; GROWTH,"[Du, Xiafang; Wu, Guan; Cheng, Jian; Dang, Hui; Ma, Kangzhe; Zhang, Ya-Wen; Tan, Peng-Feng; Chen, Su] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Su] Jiangsu Key Lab Fine Chem & Funct Polymer Mat, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Tech University,"Chen, S (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Chen, S (corresponding author), Jiangsu Key Lab Fine Chem & Funct Polymer Mat, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",chensu@njtech.edu.cn,"Chen, Su/IXX-1915-2023; Chen, Su/J-7343-2012; Wu, Guan/P-1874-2015","Chen, Su/0000-0002-3799-469X; Wu, Guan/0000-0002-0025-812X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [21474052]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0401700],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); National Key Research and Development Program of China,This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (21474052) and Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

It is shown that through the use of an empirical correction model, the systematic errors in low-level DFT calculations can be controlled to produce reliable thermochemistry. It is further shown that the G3 results have a more regular systematic error and as a consequence a simpler model may be used to correct for systematic deviations. It is seen that the resulting enthalpy of formation values are in good agreement with the available experimental data, and that the predictions are sufficiently robust to point out certain errors in experimental determinations. This work was done as part of a larger effort to create a curated data set of property data for a large set of PAH molecules. In furtherance of this goal, UV/Vis spectra have been computed using time-dependent DFT.

However, the study on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) from halide perovskite nanomaterials is still in its infancy due to their instability, sensitivity, and difficulties in purification and film formation. Here, we propose a scraping coating method for the fabrication of high-quality halide perovskite quantum dot (QD) film on electrode, which shows dense and uniform packing with minimum grain size. When CsPbBr3 QDs are taken as model materials, highly efficient ECL can be obtained from such perovskite QD film with anhydrous ethyl acetate as both electrolyte and coreactant. The CsPbBr3 QD film displays intense and stable ECL with ultranarrow emission spectrum bandwidth (24 nm). The CsPbBr3 QD film shows an extremely high ECL efficiency which is up to 5 times relative to the standard Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) /tri-n-propylamine system. This approach is universal and also applies to hybrid organic inorganic halide perovskite QDs.

The entire cloud application service architecture mainly includes four parts: cloud service management, cloud application service rapid creation and deployment, dynamic process configuration, and unified identity authentication. Based on the basic theory of workflow, the process status and business services of cloud application services are discussed. The BP neural network weight optimization model based on the improved quantum evolution method is studied, and a method that combines the improved quantum evolution algorithm (IQEA) and the BP algorithm to complete the back propagation neural network training is proposed, that is, the IQEA-BP algorithm. Firstly, the traditional quantum evolution algorithm is improved, and then, the improved quantum evolution algorithm is used to optimize the network weights as a whole to overcome the shortcomings of the BP algorithm that is easy to fall into the local optimum; then, we use the BP algorithm to find the better weight as the initial value to improve the training and prediction accuracy of the network. In order to enrich the school education quality evaluation system, this article adds soft indicators that can reflect school education performance on the basis of the existing National Education Inspection Team indicators and uses analytical methods to prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the new evaluation indicators. The X1-X10 index data is selected as the evaluation index of the school education quality evaluation system in this paper. Testing the performance of the BP neural network, the accuracy rate of the school education quality evaluation is 93.3%, the average absolute error is 0.067, and the accuracy and recall rate of the test set grade gradient of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 are all 93%, indicating that the IQEA-BP neural network algorithm has a good effect on the evaluation of school education quality.",RECOMMENDATION; INTELLIGENCE,"[Liu, Hong-Xia; Zhang, Yong-Heng] Yulin Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Yulin 719000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tsai, Sang-Bing] WUYI Univ, Reg Green Econ Dev Res Ctr, Sch Business, Nanping, Peoples R China","Yulin University; Wuyi University, Fujian","Liu, HX (corresponding author), Yulin Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Yulin 719000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Tsai, SB (corresponding author), WUYI Univ, Reg Green Econ Dev Res Ctr, Sch Business, Nanping, Peoples R China.",17719630982@163.com; sangbing@hotmail.com,,"Tsai, Sang-Bing/0000-0001-6988-5829",Shaanxi Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project [19ZY016]; Shaanxi Education Scientific Planning Project [SGH16H229],Shaanxi Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project; Shaanxi Education Scientific Planning Project,This work is partially supported by the Shaanxi Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project (19ZY016) and Shaanxi Education Scientific Planning Project in 2016 (SGH16H229).,,26,0,0,2,13,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1530-8669,1530-8677,,WIREL COMMUN MOB COM,Wirel.

This approach combines the versatility of colloidal semiconducting nanoparticles (bright emission, solubility, and high stability) with the spatial precision of optical lithography to create robust large-area optical lasing arrays (up to a few thousand disks). Specifically, microdisk lasers with high quality factors (within 1000-2000) are fabricated with predefined size and shape (as controlled by master templates) with high consistency and throughput, essentially providing a new approach to fabricate difficult-to-control on-chip optical cavities in a low-cost and effective manner. Notably, the number of longitudinal cavity modes in the microdisk laser can be precisely controlled by varying the microdisks' diameter, allowing for either near-single mode or multimode operation while preserving high quality factors. Furthermore, the cross-linking of quantum dots imparts high chemical resistance and mechanical robustness that helps retain the structural integrity under harsh processing conditions (such as sonication or direct exposure to various solvents). As such, these quantum dot microdisk laser arrays are promising candidates for advancing the development of large-area, low-cost on-chip photonic structures with controlled lasing modes.",layer-by-layer assembly; microdisk lasers; optical gain; quantum dots; whispering gallery modes,"[Lin, Chun Hao; Smith, Marcus J.; Malak, Sidney T.; Jung, Jaehan; Yoon, Young Jun; Lin, Zhiqun; Tsukruk, Vladimir V.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zeng, Qingji; Lafalce, Evan; Vardeny, Zeev Valy] Univ Utah, Dept Phys & Astron, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Smith, Marcus J.] Air Force Res Lab, Aerosp Syst Directorate, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; US Air Force Research Laboratory,"Tsukruk, VV (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",Vladimir@mse.gatech.edu,"Yoon, Young Jun/L-1747-2019; Lin, Zhiqun/G-6136-2011",,"Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0037, FA9550-16-1-0187, FA9550-14-1-0269]; UES-AFRL [S-977-022-001]; Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) scholarship - OSD-T&E (Office of Secretary Defense-Test and Evaluation); National Defense Education Program (NDEP)/BA-1, Basic Research, SMART Program office [Defense-Wide/PE0601120D8Z, N00244-09-1-0081]","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); UES-AFRL; Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) scholarship - OSD-T&E (Office of Secretary Defense-Test and Evaluation); National Defense Education Program (NDEP)/BA-1, Basic Research, SMART Program office","Financial support is acknowledged from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research FA9550-14-1-0037 (Synthetic Photonics Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative), FA9550-16-1-0187, FA9550-14-1-0269, and the UES-AFRL support S-977-022-001.

However, existing crowdsourcing platforms or systems could suffer from task allocation and quality control problems. In this article, we first prove that there exist two dilemmas while tackling the above issues by using a game-theoretic approach. To overcome this challenge, we are focusing on exploiting quantum crowdsourcing schemes in which the welfare of requestor or worker can be maximized since quantum players share the extended strategy space, and the introduction of entanglement offers a new method of depicting fine-grained relations between players. Specifically, we propose a quantum game model for quota-oriented crowdsourcing game to address dilemmas in task allocation. The result indicates the dilemma based on classical strategy will disappear with the increment of entanglement degree. While in the quality-oriented crowdsourcing game, we adopt a density matrix approach to calculate the optimal payoffs of both sides, which demonstrates the superiority of our quantum strategy. Moreover, our quantum scheme is generic since it is compatible with the schemes from a classical perspective. Hence, our noteworthy quantum crowdsourcing schemes offer a promising alternative route for tackling dilemmas in crowdsourcing scenarios.",Games; Crowdsourcing; Task analysis; Game theory; Resource management; Quantum entanglement; Crowdsourcing; dilemma; quantum game; entanglement,"[Xu, Minghui; Cheng, Xiuzhen] George Washington Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Wang, Shengling] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qin] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Sheng, Hao] Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci, State Key Lab Software Dev Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Hao] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data & Brain Comp, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",George Washington University; Beijing Normal University; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Beihang University; Beihang University,"Xu, MH (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mhxu@gwu.edu; wangshengling@bnu.edu.cn; qinhu@iu.edu; shenghao@buaa.edu.cn; cheng@gwu.edu,"Hu, Qin/AFL-7875-2022","Hu, Qin/0000-0002-8847-8345; Xu, Minghui/0000-0003-3675-3461","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1002000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61472044, 61772080, 61771289, 61832012, 61861166002]; US National Science Foundation [IIS-1741279, CNS-1704397]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2017YFB1002000, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61472044, Grant 61772080, Grant 61771289, Grant 61832012, and Grant 61861166002, and in part by the US National Science Foundation under Grant IIS-1741279 and Grant CNS-1704397.",,37,3,3,1,6,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",2327-4697,,,IEEE T NETW SCI ENG,IEEE Trans.

The effectiveness of innovative practices and resources is influenced by a multitude of factors. This study aimed to propose a new quantum-based approach in agriculture using homoeopathic methodology which incorporates theories and concepts of quantum physics and employs a wave-based methodology for the functional measurement phase. A novel utilization of thermal imaging technology is suggested, wherein each pixel of the image indicates the wave parameters, frequency, or amplitude of wave, is proposed to analyse the functional information of the plant. The relationship between the new quantumagriculture-based method and the functional characteristics of flour as measured by biophotonic emissions was estimated, and the findings of this preliminary study on wheat flour are presented. Our preliminary results (i) confirm the superior performance of quantum agriculture (QA) based proposed soil and plant treatments, and (ii) suggest that quantitative analysis based on precise measurements of biophoton emission will provide a novel reliable tool for monitoring the quality of wheat in the future.

In an urge to replace cobalt as a binder phase, a demand on understanding the magnetic response as a function of composition on the atomic scale is growing. In this paper, a theoretical description of the measured weight-specific magnetic saturation of hard metals as a function of the tungsten weight fraction present in the cobalt binder phase, based on first-principle calculations, is established for standard WC-Co. The predicted magnetic saturation agrees well with the experimental one.

Although the synthetic strategies for size control are well established and widely applicable to various QD systems, the structural characteristics of QDs, such as morphology and crystallinity, are tuned mostly by trial and error in a material-specific manner. Here, we show that reaction temperature and precursor reactivity, the two parameters governing the surface-reaction kinetics during growth, govern the structural quality of QDs. For conventional precursors, their reactivity is determined by their chemical structure. Therefore, a variation of precursor reactivity requires the synthesis of different precursor molecules. As a result, existing precursor selections often have significant gaps in reactivity or require synthesis of precursor libraries comprising a large number of variants. We designed a sulfur precursor employing a boron-sulfur bond, which enables controllable modulation of their reactivity using commercially available Lewis bases. This precursor chemistry allows systematic optimization of the reaction temperature and precursor reactivity using a single precursor and grows high-quality QDs from cores of various sizes and materials. This work provides critical insights into the nanoparticle growth process and precursor designs, enabling the systematic preparation of high-quality QD of any sizes and materials.

However, defects on GQDs hinder these properties, and only a few studies have reported fabricating high-quality GQDs with high crystallinity and few impurities. In this study, we present a novel yet simple approach to synthesizing high-quality GQDs that involves annealing silicon carbide (SiC) under low vacuum while introducing hydrogen (H) etching gas; no harmful chemicals are required in the process. The fabricated GQDs are composed of a few graphene layers and possess high crystallinity, few defects and high purity, while being free from oxygen functional groups. The edges of the GQDs are hydrogen-terminated. High-quality GQDs form on the etched SiC when the etching rates of Si and C atoms are monitored. The size of the fabricated GQDs and the surface morphology of SiC can be altered by changing the operating conditions.

Compared with developed countries, service quality should be the bottleneck for Chinese service industry. On the background of three major telecommunications service providers in China, the functions of customer perceived utilities are established. With the goal of consumer's perceived utility maximization, the classic Nash equilibrium solution and quantum equilibrium solution are obtained. Then a numerical example is studied and the changing trend of service quality and customer perceived utility is further analyzed by the influence of the entanglement operator. Finally, it is proved that quantum game solution is better than Nash equilibrium solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Among the existing approaches, closed-loop leaning control is an effective choice. Its efficiency depends on the learning algorithm employed, thus deserving algorithmic comparisons for its practical applications. Here we assess three representative learning algorithms, including GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE), improved Nelder-Mead (NMplus), and Differential Evolution (DE), by searching for high-quality control pulses to prepare the Bell state. We first implement each algorithm experimentally in a nuclear magnetic resonance system and then conduct a numerical study considering the impact of some possible significant experimental uncertainties. The experiments report the successful preparation of the high-fidelity target state by the three algorithms, while NMplus converges fastest, and these results coincide with the numerical simulations when potential uncertainties are negligible. However, under certain significant uncertainties, these algorithms possess distinct performance with respect to their resulting precision and efficiency, and DE shows the best robustness. This study provides insight to aid in the practical application of different closed-loop learning algorithms in realistic physical scenarios.",,"[Yang, Xiao-dong; Peng, Xinhua] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiao-dong; Peng, Xinhua] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiao-dong; Peng, Xinhua] Univ Sci & Technol China, CAS Key Lab Microscale Magnet Resonance, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiao-dong; Arenz, Christian; Pelczer, Istvan; Chen, Qi-Ming; Rabitz, Herschel] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Wu, Re-Bing] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wu, Re-Bing] BNRist, Ctr Quantum Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xinhua] Univ Sci & Technol China, Synerget Innovat Ctr Quantum Informat & Quantum P, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Princeton University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; CAS Center for Excellence in Quantum Information & Quantum Physics","Peng, XH (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.;Peng, XH (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.;Peng, XH (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, CAS Key Lab Microscale Magnet Resonance, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.;Rabitz, H (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Wu, RB (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Wu, RB (corresponding author), BNRist, Ctr Quantum Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Peng, XH (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Synerget Innovat Ctr Quantum Informat & Quantum P, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",rbwu@tsinghua.edu.cn; xhpeng@ustc.edu.cn; hrabitz@princeton.edu,"Arenz, Christian/JRX-3623-2023; Yang, Gilbert/HGE-1228-2022; Wu, Rebing/A-3647-2013; Peng, Xinhua/H-4535-2014; Yang, Xiaodong/GSJ-1255-2022","Yang, Gilbert/0000-0003-4509-6045; Wu, Rebing/0000-0003-3545-8700; Peng, Xinhua/0000-0001-5260-2976; CHEN, QIMING/0000-0003-1870-5327; Rabitz, Herschel/0000-0002-4433-6142","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0306600]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11661161018, 11927811]; Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies [AHY050000]; US ARO [W911NF-19-1-0382]; NSFC [61833010, 61773232]; US DOE [DE-FG02-02ER15344]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies; US ARO; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"X.P. acknowledges the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFA0306600), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 11661161018 and No. 11927811), and the Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies (Grant No. AHY050000), and C.A. acknowledges the US ARO (Grant No. W911NF-19-1-0382).

With multinary Ag-In-Zn-S (AIZS) QDs as an example, here, we present a simple method for the extraction and screening of efficient photo catalysts by combination of gradient centrifugation and electro-chemiluminescence (ECL). With controllable introduction of poor solvent, the crude QDs were separated into five individual samples by gradient centrifugation, from which ECL tests were performed to get the surface state information for photocatalyst screening. By the combination of size-selective centrifugation and ECL screening, we were able to get the high-activity component (AIZS-#4), which achieved 1.68 mmol.g(-1)h(-1), 6 times higher than that of the initial AIZS QDs.

Thanks to the host-guest assembly between -CD and the surface ligand of QDs under the moderate interfacial conditions, the beforehand prepared lipophilic QDs change into amphiphilic ones; the as-synthesized amphipathic QDs have good dispersibility in water and toluene, along with greatly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QYs) of 80-82%. We then demonstrate the use of amphiphilic QDs as colour conversion materials to construct a liquid crystal display (LCD) backlight with a wide colour gamut up to 112%.

In recent years, there has been much interest in studying such a strong coupling in the limit of single emitters. However, the lossy nature of PCs, reflected in their broad spectra, limits their quality factors and hence their performance as cavities. Here, we study the effect of the adhesion layer used in the fabrication of metal nanostructures on the spectral linewidths of bowtie-structured PCs. Using dark-field microspectroscopy, as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy, it is found that a reduction in the thickness of the chromium adhesion layer we use from 3 nm to 0.1 nm decreases the linewidths of both bright and dark plasmonic modes. We further show that it is possible to fabricate bowtie PCs without any adhesion layer, in which case the linewidth may be narrowed by as much as a factor of 2. Linewidth reduction increases the quality factor of these PCs accordingly, and it is shown to facilitate reaching the strong-coupling regime with semiconductor quantum dots.",ADHESION LAYER; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; METAL PARTICLES; GOLD NANORODS; SURFACE; LINEWIDTH; TI; SPECTROSCOPY; DEPENDENCE; DYNAMICS,"[Bitton, Ora; Houben, Lothar] Weizmann Inst Sci, Chem Res Support Dept, POB 26, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel; [Gupta, Satyendra Nath; Cao, Yong; Vaskevich, Alexander; Yelin, Tamar; Haran, Gilad] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Chem & Biol Phys, POB 26, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel; [Vaskevich, Alexander] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mat & Interfaces, POB 26, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel",Weizmann Institute of Science; Weizmann Institute of Science; Weizmann Institute of Science,"Haran, G (corresponding author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Chem & Biol Phys, POB 26, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel.",gilad.haran@weizmann.ac.il,"Houben, Lothar/K-3593-2013; Vaskevich, Alexander/G-9019-2011","Houben, Lothar/0000-0003-0200-3611; Vaskevich, Alexander/0000-0002-9147-4150; Haran, Gilad/0000-0003-1837-9779",,,,,57,3,3,1,19,AIP Publishing,MELVILLE,"1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0021-9606,1089-7690,,J CHEM PHYS,J.

The intensity of these peaks decreases as a function of temperature, while the linewidths demonstrate a complex and peculiar behavior. At low pumping the widths of all peaks remain quite narrow (< 0.1 meV) in the whole temperature range studied, 4-30 K. At the stronger pumping, the linewidth first increases and then drops down with the temperature rise. Pump-probe experiments show two characteristic time scales in the exciton decay, < 10 ps and 15-45 ns, respectively. We interpret all these data by an interplay between the exciton recombination within the light cone, the exciton relaxation from a nonradiative reservoir to the light cone, and the thermal dissociation of the nonradiative excitons. The broadening of the low energy exciton lines is governed by the radiative recombination and scattering with reservoir excitons, while for the higher energy states the linewidths are also dependent on the acoustic phonon relaxation processes.",RADIATIVE LIFETIMES; 2-DIMENSIONAL EXCITONS; BAND OFFSETS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; DEPENDENCE; RECOMBINATION; LUMINESCENCE; TEMPERATURE; TRANSITIONS; SCATTERING,"[Trifonov, A.

However, the complicated compositions make it challenging to evaluate their quality consistency by common methods. Herein, we explored comprehensive and efficient strategies by combining the multiple techniques to monitor and assess the characteristics of KCs. We employed the fingerprints and corresponding quantum fingerprints by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet (UV), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The antioxidant activity profiles were also studied combined with the result of three-dimensional quantum fingerprints and showed a good correlation with the internal structure and physical-chemical state. Furthermore, the 17 samples were separated and identified simultaneously by HPLC quantitative fingerprint, of which four active ingredients (chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, vitexin and isovitexin) were quantitatively determined. The 17 samples were successfully classified into different grades by the systematically quantified fingerprint method (SQFM) and the quality of the samples was integrated according to the mean algorithm. The mean algorithm fusion of different evaluation techniques was compared to reveal the relationship between them, which indicated the effective improvement in accuracy and integrality. The combination of multiple analytical techniques developed in this study would effectively improve the existing single analytical methods and provide new strategy for drug quality consistency control.

Photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) can enhance abdominal image quality, especially in combination with a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm, quantum iterative reconstruction (QIR).The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of different QIR levels on PCD-CT imaging of HCC in both phantom and patient scans.MethodsVirtual monoenergetic images at 50 keV were reconstructed using filtered back projection and all available QIR levels (QIR 1-4). Objective image quality properties were investigated in phantom experiments. The study also included 44 patients with triple-phase liver PCD-CT scans of viable HCC lesions. Quantitative image analysis involved assessing the noise, contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio of the lesions. Qualitative image analysis was performed by three raters evaluating noise, artifacts, lesion conspicuity, and overall image quality using a 5-point Likert scale.ResultsNoise power spectra in the phantom experiments showed increasing noise suppression with higher QIR levels without affecting the modulation transfer function. This pattern was confirmed in the in vivo scans, in which the lowest noise levels were found in QIR-4 reconstructions, with around a 50% reduction in median noise level compared with the filtered back projection images. As contrast does not change with QIR, QIR-4 also yielded the highest contrast-to-noise ratios. With increasing QIR levels, rater scores were significantly better for all qualitative image criteria (all p < .05).ConclusionsWithout compromising image sharpness, the best image quality of iodine contrast optimized low-keV virtual monoenergetic images can be achieved using the highest QIR level to suppress noise. Using these settings as standard reconstruction for HCC in PCD-CT imaging might improve diagnostic accuracy and confidence.",Photon-counting detector CT; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Quantum iterative reconstruction,"[Graafen, Dirk; Stoehr, Fabian; Halfmann, Moritz C.

We consider a vast class of one-dimensional many-body models which contains some of the most relevant experimental realizations of quantum data buses. In particular, we consider spin-1/2 XY and XXZ models with open boundary conditions. Our results show a significant difference between free-fermionic (noninteracting) systems (XY) and interacting ones (XXZ), where in the former case initialization can be exploited for improving the entanglement distribution, while in the latter case it also determines the quality of state transmission. In fact, we find that in noninteracting systems the exchange with fermions in the initial state of the chain always has a destructive effect, and we prove that it can be completely removed in the isotropic XX model by initializing the chain in a ferromagnetic state. On the other hand, in interacting systems constructive effects can arise by scattering between hopping fermions and a proper initialization procedure.

Improving the luminescence quality of ZnO NRs by doping with different dopants has led to many new applications in optoelectronics. The emitted color lines in ZnO can be effectively controlled by introducing defects which may be distributed over a relatively wide range. Herein, we demonstrate a new method to achieve spectrally stable blue emission from ZnO NRs. We discuss the contribution of ZnO in the observed luminescence and specifically the enhancement in violet-blue emission due to Mg doping in ZnO NRs. Doping ZnO NRs with Mg increased the external quantum efficiency by 100% and increased the color rendering index, which suggests that the quality of light generated by the Schottky LEDs can be tuned by selecting an appropriate dopant. A new strategy indicates that Mg doping plays a significant role in improving the EQE and luminescence quality of LEDs by introducing a highly efficient and spectrally stable blue emission.",Mg doped ZnO; LED; optical properties,"[Bano, N.] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",King Saud University,"Bano, N (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",nbano@ksu.edu.sa,", Ijaz/AAY-3757-2020; Bano, Nargis/AAJ-5133-2020",", Ijaz/0000-0002-2216-2604; Bano, Nargis/0000-0003-1007-9683","Research Center of the Female Scientific and Medical Colleges, King Saud University","Research Center of the Female Scientific and Medical Colleges, King Saud University","This research project was supported by a grant from the 'Research Center of the Female Scientific and Medical Colleges, Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University.",,30,2,2,2,26,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

On the contrary, white-emitting quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) can be easily produced by mixing several colors of QDs in a single emitting layer (EML). In this work, sunlike white QLEDs showing high color rendition qualities are demonstrated by incorporating five (red, yellow, green, cyan, and blue) or six (additional violet) primary colors of QDs in the EML. Based on the simulation and optimization of the multichromatic spectra, the pentachromatic and hexachromatic white QLEDs exhibit the superb color rendering index of 96-98, the color quality scales of 95-97, and the spectral similarity index of up to 86, with tunable correlated color temperatures from daylight to overcast sky. The Forster resonant energy transfers between six colors of QDs are also investigated with time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy.

These water-soluble QDs were prepared using different capping agents including 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and L-cysteine (L-Cys). The photoluminescence (PL) intensity and stability of L-Cys-capped CdTexSe1-x QDs were found to be higher than that of MPA-stabilized ones. The molar ratios of Se-to-Te upon preparation were adjusted for investigating the effect of composition on the properties of the resulting QDs.

To harness quantum computers' real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying, deletion, the transmission of qubit states, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software. Thus, developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective, resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs, ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software, iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs, and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities. We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing.

The hybrid quantum neural network algorithm is a cutting-edge approach that combines the power of quantum computing with artificial neural networks, which are widely used in machine learning and data analysis. By leveraging the cloud model, the hybrid quantum neural network algorithm can be optimized for high performance and scalability, making it an ideal solution for complex data analysis and decision-making tasks in the education sector. Moreover, this paper applies the hybrid quantum neural network algorithm to solve the problem of flexible resource allocation in low-carbon supply chain management. By using the algorithm to analyze and optimize resource allocation, TN Travel Network can reduce carbon emissions and improve sustainability while also improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. Finally, this paper designs experiments to evaluate the model effect combined with mathematical statistics.

The morphology effects of graphene seeds on the polygon growth behavior were explored by the random deposition of C-2 species on the Ni(111) surface. The results demonstrated that in the presence of the graphene seeds, hexagons can be formed directly at the seed edges, different from the pentagon-first mechanism proposed before. At the edge of the seeds, different growth behaviors were observed depending on the specific edge structure. We found that the edge structures which are consisted of more carbon atoms prefer to form more hexagons, giving rise to the higher quality of graphene. Compared with the seed C-16, C-24 has more zigzag edge structures and is expected to produce more hexagons. This has been confirmed by our simulation, where the seed C-24 produced higher quality graphene than C-16. The results suggested that the morphology of the graphene seed could affect the quality of the graphene growth.

Here, aphanitic graphite (AG), a low-cost graphite contains a large amount of small graphite nanocrystals with size of about 10 nm is used as the precursor of graphene oxide quantum dots (GO-QDs) for the first time. GO-QDs with high yield and high quality were successfully obtained directly by liquid phase exfoliating AG without high strength cutting. The yield of these GO-QDs can reach up to 40 wt. %, much higher than that obtained from flake graphite (FG) precursor (less than 10 wt. %). The size of GO-QDs can be controlled in 2-10 nm. The average thickness of GO-QDs is about 3 nm, less than 3 layer of graphene sheet.

An important characteristic of an LSC is a concentration factor (C) that can be thought of as a coefficient of effective enlargement (or contraction) of the area of a solar cell when it is coupled to the LSC. Here we use analytical and numerical Monte Carlo modeling in addition to experimental studies of quantum-dot-based LSCs to analyze the factors that influence optical concentration in practical devices. Our theoretical model indicates that the maximum value of C achievable with a given fluorophore is directly linked to the LSC quality factor (Q(LSC)) defined as the ratio of absorption coefficients at the wavelengths of incident and reemitted light. In fact, we demonstrate that the ultimate concentration limit (C-0) realized in large-area devices scales linearly with the LSC quality factor and in the case of perfect emitters and devices without back reflectors is approximately equal to Q(LSC). To test the predictions of this model, we conduct experimental studies of LSCs based on visible-light emitting II-VI core/shell quantum dots with two distinct LSC quality factors. We also investigate devices based on near-infrared emitting CuInSexS2-x quantum dots for which the large emission bandwidth allows us to assess the impact of varied Q(LSC) on the concentration factor by simply varying the detection wavelength. In all cases, we find an excellent agreement between the model and the experimental observations, suggesting that the developed formalism can be utilized for express evaluation of prospective LSC performance based on the optical spectra of LSC fluorophores, which should facilitate future efforts on the development of high-performance devices based on quantum dots as well as other types of emitters.",luminescent solar concentrator; LSC; LSC quality factor; concentration factor; optical efficiency; quantum dot,"[Klimov, Victor I.; Baker, Thomas A.; Lim, Jaehoon] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Chem, Ctr Adv Solar Photophys, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Velizhanin, Kirill A.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Ctr Adv Solar Photophys, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [McDaniel, Hunter] UbiQD LLC, 134 East Gate Dr, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Klimov, VI (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Chem, Ctr Adv Solar Photophys, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",klimov@lanl.gov,"Klimov, Victor/Y-2823-2019; Lim, Jaehoon/AEA-6789-2022; Velizhanin, Kirill A./C-4835-2008; McDaniel, Hunter Y/E-9125-2012","Klimov, Victor/0000-0003-1158-3179; Lim, Jaehoon/0000-0003-2623-3550","Center for Advanced Solar Photophysics (CASP), an Energy Frontier Research Center - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences","Center for Advanced Solar Photophysics (CASP), an Energy Frontier Research Center - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences","This work was supported by the Center for Advanced Solar Photophysics (CASP), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences.",,44,136,147,3,61,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2330-4022,,,ACS PHOTONICS,ACS Photonics,JUN,2016,3,6,,,,,1138,1148,,10.1021/acsphotonics.6b00307,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.6b00307,,,11,"Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Optics; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Optics; Physics,DP0QW,,hybrid,,,2024-03-31,WOS:000378195300032,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the first time, we proposed system with a single barrier CdMnTe is embedded between two semi-infinite substrates. Hence, the corresponding Eigen modes energies were found to be shifted towards lower energies as the barrier thickness increases. The resulting Eigen modes are characterized by a high transmission rates but a very low quality factor values, which highlight the importance of the system periodicity. On the other hand, in order to create localized states in the band gaps, a defective system is exanimated. Indeed, a defect barrier is inserted in a perfect multi-quantum wells (MQWs) system, basically made of repeated CdMnTe barriers and CdTe wells. This defective system can create multi defect modes in the electronic band gaps. The analysis of the transmittance spectra of the defect states evidences a shift to lower energies by increasing the defect thickness with fixed parameters of the system. These defect states move toward higher energy regions, when the concentration of defect increases. In addition, the energy of the defect states varying from 600 meV to 785 meV. We found one defect state for a defect concentration equal to 0.7, when the defect thickness is equal to 5 A degrees. Otherwise, for a defect concentration equal to 0.1, with a defect thickness of 150 A degrees, we found two defect states appeared inside the gaps. While, three defect states were found for a concentration interval between 0.3 and 0.5 and a defect thickness equal respectively to 127 A degrees and 145 A degrees. These defect states have higher quality factors reaching 7630000. Moreover, it shown that the number of gaps modes depends on the defect concentration's and thickness' parameters.

Ten types of disturbances are considered for the classification problem. Simulation results indicate that the classification performance of QNN is better than back propagation neural network (BPNN). The recognition capability of the QNN-DS classifier is compared with BPNN-DS, probabilistic neural network with voting rules (PNN-VR) at the decision level, and only one QNN with information fusion at the feature level.

Therefore, steady-state PQ monitoring data show a distinct imbalanced structure (i.e. unequal distribution). To ensure the efficient assessment of PQ performance, new and more appropriate tools for analyzing these data are needed. In this paper, an analysis method based on Quantum clustering is proposed, aiming to address the imbalanced structure of monitoring data. Firstly, the imbalanced structure of PQ monitoring data is analyzed. Secondly, Quantum clustering is performed on the PQ monitoring data and several disparate patterns of clusters are recognized. Thirdly, cluster severity index of cluster and the region severity index of region are defined to quantify the PQ performance of a cluster and a region, respectively. The cluster severity index is defined according to the sum of the proportions between cluster centers and limit for the respective PQ index. The region severity index is defined according to the proportions of PQ monitoring data of each region belonging to the different clusters with the corresponding cluster severity index. By sorting the region severity index in descending order, regions with poorer PQ performance become a higher-ranking place, which enables an easy comparison among regions. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the PQ monitoring data of 11 regions in a large city in China. The method can effectively distill diverse abnormal patterns from substantially imbalanced monitoring data, which is beneficial for easy and automatic detection of regions having issues with PQ indices exceeding defined limits.",Power quality; Comprehensive assessment; Quantum clustering; Pattern recognition,"[Zhong, Qing; Liang, Jiahao; Wang, Longjun; Wang, Gang] South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect Power, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhong] China Southern Power Grid Co Ltd, Elect Power Test Res Inst Guangzhou Power Supply B, Guangzhou 510410, Peoples R China; [Meyer, Jan] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Elect Power Syst & High Voltage Engn, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",South China University of Technology; China Southern Power Grid; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Zhong, Q (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect Power, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",epqzhong@scut.edu.cn,,"Zhong, Qing/0000-0001-8514-9581",,,,,21,1,1,3,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0378-7796,1873-2046,,ELECTR POW SYST RES,Electr.

In particular, defects hosted by two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are a promising candidate for next-generation single photon sources, due to its chemical and thermal robustness and high brightness at room temperature. The 2D crystal lattice of hBN allows for a high extraction efficiency and easy integration into photonic circuits. Here we develop plasma etching techniques with subsequent high-temperature annealing to reliably create defects. We show how different fabrication parameters influence the defect formation probability and the emitter brightness. A full optical characterization reveals the higher quality of the created quantum emitters, represented by a narrow spectrum, short excited state lifetime, and high single-photon purity. We also investigated the photostability on short and very long time scales.

Using infrared absorption spectroscopy, we probe subband structures of multilayer black phosphorus with tens of atomic layers, revealing clear signatures for optical transitions with subband index as high as 10, far from what was attainable previously. Surprisingly, in addition to allowed transitions, an unexpected series of forbidden transitions is also evidently observed, which enables us to determine energy spacings separately for conduction and valence subbands.

Borophene is the lightest two-dimensional (2D) layered material, with high carrier mobility and high hardness. In this work, a sonication-assisted liquid-phase preparation technique was developed to prepare borophene quantum dots (BQDs) with uniform size, good dispersion, and high stability. The use of BQDs as a surface passivation agent on the TiO2 layer in an inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell was presented. It is found that the boron atoms undergo strong interactions with TiO2 and the perovskite, reducing interfacial recombination and forming a cascade energy alignment for effective charge transport. A CsPbI2Br solar cell with a thin BQD interlayer shows high efficiency of 15.31%, whereas the efficiency was 14.24% for the device with no BQDs. The enhancement in efficiency is mainly due to carrier recombination suppression and a decrease in the defect density at the TiO2/CsPbI2Br interface after BDQ treatment.

Therefore, we used an efficient microwave-assisted hydrothermal method to synthesize high-quality CuInZnS/ZnS QDs with a high quantum yield and good chemical stability. On the surface of CuInZnS QDs, the ZnS shell was coated for the QD surface passivation, which could reduce the QD, surface defects. As a result, the fluorescence properties and quantum yield of CuInZnS/ZnS QDs have been improved significantly. This new microwave-assisted hydrothermal method possesses several features: (i) the CuInZnS/ZnS QDs thus produced have a high quantum yield (23%) and good chemical stability (more than two weeks). (ii) The CuInZnS/ZnS QDs show lower toxicity and better biocompatibility than other traditional QDs.

Moreover, pixelated RGB arrays, 2-in. wafer-scale white light emission, and an integrated small footprint white light device were demonstrated. The experimental results showed that the intensity of red, blue, and green (RGB) emissions exhibited considerable enhancement because of the high reflectivity in the UV region by the DBR structure, which subsequently increased the use in the UV optical pumping of RGB QDs. In this experiment, a pulsed spray coating method was crucial in providing uniform RGB layers, and the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film was used as the interface layer between each RGB color to avoid cross-contamination and self-assembly of QDs. Furthermore, the chromaticity coordinates of QDLEDs with the DBR structure remained constant under various pumping powers in the large area sample, whereas a larger shift toward high color temperatures was observed in the integrated device.

Beyond the state-of-the-art Cd-containing quantum wires (QWs), heavy-metal-free semiconductor QWs, such as ZnSe, are of great interest for next-generation environmental-benign applications. Unfortunately, simultaneous, on-demand manipulation of their radial and axial sizes-that allows strong quantum confinement in the blue-light region-has so far been challenging. Here we present a two-step catalyzed growth strategy that enables independent, high-precision and wide-range controls over the diameter and length of ZnSe QWs. We find that a new epitaxial orientation between the cubic-phase Ag2Se solid catalyst and wurtzite ZnSe QWs kinetically favors the formation of defect-free ultrathin QWs. Thanks to their high uniformity, the resulting blue-light-active, phase-pure ZnSe QWs exhibit well-defined excitonic absorption with the 1S(e)-1S(h) transition linewidth as narrow as sub-13 nm. Combining the transient absorption spectroscopy, we further show that surface electron traps in these ZnSe QWs can be eliminated by thiol passivation, which results in long-lived charge carriers and high-efficiency solar-to-hydrogen conversion.",zinc selenide; colloidal synthesis; quantum wires; heavy-metal-free; solar conversion,"[Li, Yi; Zhang, Chong; Wu, Liang; Liu, Guo-Qiang; Li, Hui-Hui; Zhang, Yu-Zhuo; Shao, Zhen-Chao; He, Zhen; Yu, Shu-Hong] Univ Sci & Technol China, Inst Biomimet Mat & Chem, Hefei Natl Res Ctr Phys Sci Microscale, Dept Chem, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Tian, Jie] Univ Sci & Technol China, Engn & Mat Sci Expt Ctr, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Yu, SH (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Inst Biomimet Mat & Chem, Hefei Natl Res Ctr Phys Sci Microscale, Dept Chem, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.",shyu@ustc.edu.cn,"zheng, liang/JVO-2610-2024; CAO, ying/KFA-2972-2024; peng, jin/JRW-4493-2023; Lin, Yi/KEH-1784-2024; cheng, qian/KFB-6227-2024; chen, yan/JRY-4645-2023; YE, Chen/KFR-3858-2024; He, Zhen/M-2153-2018; zhou, wei/JQJ-0490-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023","He, Zhen/0000-0001-8565-9717; Wu, Liang/0009-0003-2377-093X",,,,,47,2,3,8,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2095-5138,2053-714X,,NATL SCI REV,Natl.

When the layer C is double positive medium, there appear n+2 transmission peaks of which the number and the position are adjustable; when the layer C is double negative medium, only one transmission peaks will be found in the center of the band gap and its quality can be adjusted by period n and n(C), the refraction rate of layer C.

Dynamical scattering theory has been used to simulate the x-ray diffraction profiles so as to model the structures and to assess the quality of the grown interfaces. There is good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data. A systematic comparison of a set of ten-period MQWs with different well widths is also reported together with a discussion of the comparison between a single quantum well (QW) with five- and ten-period MQWs all with the same well and barrier widths and alloy composition. The well and barrier widths deduced from the x-ray measurements agree within experimental error with those predicted from the growth parameters, however, the In content of the wells appears to be substantially lower than that expected. This is discussed in terms of a carbon incorporation model.

We here present a measure of the quality of such a token: the relative entropy of frameness. This is defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and the nearest G-invariant state. Unlike the relative entropy of entanglement, this quantity is straightforward to calculate, and we find it to be precisely equal to the G-asymmetry, a measure of frameness introduced by Vaccaro et al. It is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the group element encoded into the token and the group element that may be extracted from it by measurement. In this sense, it quantifies the extent to which the token successfully simulates a full reference frame. We also show that despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory, the regularized relative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate of interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum reference frame. Finally, we show how these investigations yield an approach to bounding the relative entropy of entanglement.",ENTANGLEMENT; CONTINUITY,"[Gour, Gilad] Univ Calgary, Dept Math & Stat, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Gour, Gilad] Univ Calgary, Inst Quantum Informat Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Marvian, Iman] Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Spekkens, Robert W.] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Waterloo; Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics,"Gour, G (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Math & Stat, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",gour@math.ucalgary.ca; imarvian@uwaterloo.ca; rspekkens@perimeterinstitute.ca,"Wang, Xin/R-9850-2017","Wang, Xin/0000-0002-0641-3186",NSERC; MITACS; Royal Society and from the European Union [IST- 3- 015848]; SCALA [CT-015714]; QIP IRC [GR/S821176/01]; government of Canada through Industry Canada and by the Province of Ontario through the Ministry of Research and Innovation; Mike and Ophelia Lazaridis Foundation,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); MITACS; Royal Society and from the European Union; SCALA; QIP IRC; government of Canada through Industry Canada and by the Province of Ontario through the Ministry of Research and Innovation; Mike and Ophelia Lazaridis Foundation,"G.

In this report, we synthesized high-quality CuInS2/ZnS (CIS/ZnS) QDs without using conventional toxic heavy metals. These QDs exhibited improved photoluminescence (PL) properties, with tunable emission peaks ranging from 550 to 800 nm and a maximum PL quantum yield (QY) up to 80%.

The Al0.95Ga0.05Sb buffer layer is important to achieve low substrate leakage and guarantee good channel material quality and high hole mobility. We grew buffer layers with various Sb effective flux conditions using molecular beam epitaxy to obtain high crystal quality and proper electrical properties. We systematically evaluated the relationship between the crystal quality and electrical properties using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscope, Raman, and the Hall effect measurement system. Then, on this optimized buffer layer, we grew the In0.2Al0.8Sb/In0.25Ga0.75Sb/linear-graded Al0.8Ga0.2Sb QW structure to obtain high hole mobility with compressive strain. Moreover, the compressive strain and hole mobility were measured by Raman and Hall effect measurement system. The results show a compressive strain value of 1.1% in In0.25Ga0.75Sb QW channel, which is very close to the theoretical value of 1.1% from lattice mismatch, exhibiting the highest hole mobility of 1170 cm(2)/V s among reported mobility in In0.25Ga0.75Sb QW.

In this work, we report on the enhancement of EQE and the quality of ZnO NR-based hetrojunction white LEDs fabricated on a p-GaN substrate using a low temperature solution method. Cathodoluminescence spectra demonstrate that ultraviolet (UV) emission decreases and visible deep band emission increases with an increase in the length of the ZnO NRs. The UV emission could be internally reabsorbed by the ZnO NR excitation, thus enhancing the emission intensity of the visible deep band. Photocurrent measurements validated the fact that the EQE depends on the size of ZnO NRs, increasing by 87% with an increase in the length of the ZnO NRs. Furthermore, the quality of white light was measured and clearly indicated an increase in the color rendering indices of the LEDs with an increase in the length of the ZnO NRs, confirming that the quality of light generated by LEDs can be tuned by varying the length of the ZnO NRs. These results suggest that the EQE and visible deep band emission from n-ZnONRs/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs can be effectively controlled by adjusting the length of the ZnO NRs, which can be useful for realizing tunable white LEDs.",ZnO nanostructures; heterojunction LEDs; tunable white LEDs,"[Bano, N.; Sawaf, S.; Alshammari, Abeer] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hussain, I.] Ecospk AB Norrkoping, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Saleemi, F.] Govt Coll Women Univ, Sialkot, Pakistan",King Saud University,"Bano, N (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",ijaz75@hotmail.com,"Bano, Nargis/AAJ-5133-2020; , Ijaz/AAY-3757-2020; alshammari, abeer/AAC-3577-2019",", Ijaz/0000-0002-2216-2604; alshammari, abeer/0000-0002-9571-8060; Saleemi, Farhat/0000-0003-1303-494X; Saleemi, Farhat/0000-0002-5101-7131; Bano, Nargis/0000-0003-1007-9683","'Research Center of the Female Scientific and Medical Colleges', King Saud University","'Research Center of the Female Scientific and Medical Colleges', King Saud University","This research project was supported by a grant from the 'Research Center of the Female Scientific and Medical Colleges, Deanship of Scientific Research', King Saud University.",,32,10,10,0,31,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0957-4484,1361-6528,,NANOTECHNOLOGY,Nanotechnology,JUN 16,2017,28,24,,,,,,,245203,10.1088/1361-6528/aa6f7b,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/aa6f7b,,,6,"Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,EW4ZF,28540864,,,,2024-03-31,WOS:000402513500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Enhancing the quantum efficiency of quantum wells in nanowires and minimizing intrinsic absorption are necessary for reducing the threshold of nanowire lasers and are promising for wavelength tunable emitters and detectors. Here, we report on growth and optimization of GaAs1-xSbx/Al1-yGayAs quantum well hetero-structures formed radially around pure zinc blende GaAs core nanowires. The emitted photon energy from GaAs0.89Sb0.11 quantum well (1.371 eV) is smaller than the GaAs core, thus showing advantages over GaAs1-xSbx/Al1-yGayAs quantum well nanowires in photon emission. The high optical quality quantum well (internal quantum efficiency reaches as high as 90%) is carefully positioned so that the quantum well coincides with the maximum of the transverse electric (TE01) mode intensity profile. The obtained superior optical performance combined with the supported Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity in the nanowire leads to the strong amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Detailed studies of the amplified cavity mode are carried out by spatial spectral photoluminescence (PL) imaging, where emission from nanowire is resolved both spatially and spectrally. Resonant emission is generated at nanowire ends and is polarized perpendicular to the nanowire, in agreement with the simulated polarization characteristics of the TE01 mode in the nanowire. The observation of strong ASE for single QW nanowire at room temperature shows the potential application of GaAs1-xSbx QW nanowires as low threshold infrared nanowire lasers.",GAAS NANOWIRES; SHELL GROWTH; TWIN-FREE; EFFICIENCY; HETEROSTRUCTURES; MULTICOLOR,"[Yuan, Xiaoming] Cent S Univ, Sch Phys & Elect, Hunan Key Lab Supermicrostruct & Ultrafast Proc, 932 South Lushan Rd, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Xiaoming; Saxena, Dhruv; Caroff, Philippe; Mokkapati, Sudha; Tan, Hark Hoe; Jagadish, Chennupati] Australian Natl Univ, Dept Elect Mat Engn, Res Sch Phys & Engn, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Lockrey, Mark] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Natl Fabricat Facil, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Wang, Fan] Macquarie Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Fac Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Central South University; Australian National University; Australian National University; Macquarie University,"Yuan, X (corresponding author), Cent S Univ, Sch Phys & Elect, Hunan Key Lab Supermicrostruct & Ultrafast Proc, 932 South Lushan Rd, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Yuan, X (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Dept Elect Mat Engn, Res Sch Phys & Engn, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",xiaoming.yuan@csu.edu.cn,"Tan, Hark Hoe/M-1148-2015; Caroff, Philippe/B-7335-2008; Caroff, Philippe/O-4664-2019; Lockrey, Mark/AAX-6075-2020; wang, fan/KCY-4343-2024; Lockrey, Mark/M-6010-2017; Jagadish, Chennupati/L-1957-2015","Caroff, Philippe/0000-0003-0160-1572; Lockrey, Mark/0000-0002-0050-2858; wang, fan/0000-0001-7403-3305; Lockrey, Mark/0000-0002-0050-2858; Saxena, Dhruv/0000-0003-0486-7333; Jagadish, Chennupati/0000-0003-1528-9479; yuan, xiaoming/0000-0001-6840-6136",Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The Australian Research Council is acknowledged for financial support.

Their quality can be hampered by spectral, temporal, or spatial distinguishability of the two photons of a generated pair. Even when such defects have been corrected, the ultimate quality of the SPDC source is limited by the intrinsic multiple pair generation. In this paper, the effect of transmission, filtering and detection losses and asymmetrical spectral bandwidths in the photon pair paths on the visibility of the two-photon interference delivered by the SPDC source and its useful pair rate are investigated. In this investigation, two subcases are distinguished: deterministic and statistical splittings of the generated pairs, whatever the coherence of the multiple pairs. We show that the visibility is strongly degraded by a spectral bandwidth asymmetry, while the losses mainly affect the measured coincidence probability. The deterministic splitting configuration is shown to be generally more advantageous, although statistical splitting may present some advantages in applications with a narrow bandwidth requirement, such as those involving quantum memories. Moreover, while pump-induced optical noise only produces small visibility reductions, dark counts of the single-photon detectors are shown to limit the maximum possible visibility, particularly in the case of high-loss photon pair sources. Because our model quantifies the intrinsic limitations due to double pair emission in a simple way, the results presented can be used to optimize the design of SPDC sources and choose the optimum trade-offs between several key parameters such as visibility, generation probabilities, and spectral bandwidth, in particular for small bandwidth SPDC sources in the perspective of quantum networking and computing applications.

The initial relaxation was predominated by formation of misfit dislocations for x < 0.25 and three-dimensional (3D) islands for x greater than or equal to 0.3. Both phenomena were observed in the transition region. Presence of misfit dislocations gave rise to degraded optical qualities in terms of luminescence efficiency and linewidth.

The traditional beam propagation method is widely used to simulate the beam profile of the passive waveguide. In order to study the active device, however, the current induced variation in the active region should also be considered in the numerical simulation model. In the model presented in this paper, the phase and the amplitude of the propagating confined field in the active waveguide are determined by a few linear and non-linear effects. The parameters relating to the linear effects, such as the intrinsic refractive index profile and the intrinsic losses of the waveguide under zero current injection, are calculated by using COMSOL-Multiphysics. While the non-linear effects, such as the modal gain and the refractive index variation induced by current injection, are considered in a rigorous way by including the rate-equation set for calculating the carrier dynamics in the active region. The parameters used in the rate-equation set are obtained by referring to the literature and fitting the experimental results of the considered terahertz lasers. By adding the current induced gain and refractive index variation, the presented beam propagation model is able to simulate many current-dependant properties of a laser, such as the output power, the gain guiding effect, and the self-focusing effect. We show in this paper that the latter two effects have influence on inner-waveguide beam profile, and the competitive balance between them determines the output beam quality. By utilizing this numerical model, the terahertz quantum cascade laser with tapered waveguide structure is simulated, and the influences of the taper angle on output power and beam quality are investigated. According to the simulation results, we find that there is an obvious increase in the output power when the taper angle is increased from 0 to 3 degree, while the increment in the output power decreases rapidly when the taper angle is further increased. Besides, we observe that for the far field the full width at half maximum of the output beam decreases sharply with increasing the taper angle. However, when the taper angle equals 8 degree, multiple lateral modes are observed, which indicates poor output beam quality of this device and poor beam coupling efficiency between this device and the power meter. Therefore, although the simulation results show that the output power of this device is higher than that of the device with 5 degree taper angle, the experiment results show that the measured output power is lower. So the taper angle is not the larger the better, but there exists an optimum value, at which the terahertz quantum cascade laser can achieve the highest effective output power.",terahertz quantum cascade laser; tapered laser; beam propagation method; numerical simulation,"[Xu Tian-Hong; Yao Chen; Wan Wen-Jian; Zhu Yong-Hao; Cao Jun-Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Microsyst & Informat Technol, Key Lab Terahertz Solid State Technol, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Microsystem & Information Technology, CAS","Cao, JC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Microsyst & Informat Technol, Key Lab Terahertz Solid State Technol, Shanghai 200050, Peoples R China.",jccao@mail.sim.ac.cn,"Yu, ZH/KBC-6889-2024; wu, jialin/JPY-4408-2023; Sun, Yuchen/JZD-1692-2024; yang, zhou/JKI-3744-2023",,"National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB339803]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2011AA010205]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61131006, 61321492, 61176086, 61404149]; Major National Development Project of Scientific Instrument and Equipment of China [2011YQ150021]; National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011ZX02707]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [YYYJ-1123-1]; International Collaboration and Innovation Program on High Mobility Materials Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Yang Fan Program, China [15YF1414400]","National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major National Development Project of Scientific Instrument and Equipment of China; National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); International Collaboration and Innovation Program on High Mobility Materials Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Shanghai Yang Fan Program, China","Project supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2014CB339803), the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2011AA010205), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61131006, 61321492, 61176086, 61404149), the Major National Development Project of Scientific Instrument and Equipment of China (Grant No. 2011YQ150021), the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2011ZX02707), the Major Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. YYYJ-1123-1), the International Collaboration and Innovation Program on High Mobility Materials Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Shanghai Yang Fan Program, China (Grant No. 15YF1414400).",,27,3,3,1,32,CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC,BEIJING,"P O BOX 603, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-3290,,,ACTA PHYS SIN-CH ED,Acta Phys.

B-doping, as well as geometrical structure, crystalline size and quality of the deposited films did not affect the photoemission properties, whereas exposure to microwave (MW) hydrogen plasma significantly improved the QPY to more than 12% at 140 nm, compared to 4-6% measured for untreated films deposited by hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) at temperatures of greater than or equal to 900 degrees C, Undoped diamond films deposited by the MW plasma chemical vapor deposition (MWCVD) at the same temperature showed a QPY of similar to 12% at 140 nm without additional hydrogen plasma treatment. A reduction in deposition temperature in the HF reactor resulted in an increase of QPY up to 11%. We have observed a decrease of the QPY in time, down to QPY values of 5-6%, for samples exposed to ambient air. The decrease occurred on time scales of hours to weeks, for non-hydrogenated and postgrowth hydrogenated films. The high QPY values were regenerated by repeating the hydrogenation process. The degradation of hydrogen-terminated films was found to be related to the adsorption of small amounts of oxygen, as detected by Auger electron spectroscopy. The observed oxygen adsorption at room temperature is in contrast to that in previous studies, claiming the stability of hydrogen-terminated diamond surfaces. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Here, we report some applications of some post-characterization such as: X-ray scanning and reciprocal mapping in clarifying composition and crystal quality in these structures; photoluminescence (PL) and FTIR in determining adsorption edge and even indicate some irradiative recombination features as well. By employing an in situ optical surface reflectivity measurement, we established a way of and evaluating an instant of strain relaxation in the course of MOVPE, which deteriorates crystal quality significantly. When strain balancing was incomplete, surface reflectivity dropped during the growth of MQWs, indicating lattice relaxation. The accumulated strain, which is defined as the average strain per period of QW multiply the number of stacking for MQWs, was roughly constant for all the MQWs samples in our experiment. Therefore, it may indicate that this overall strain may be used as a tentative criterion of critical value for lattice relaxation or to predict the maximum number of MQWs for a given value of the average strain per QW period.

This procedure involves the parametrization of force fields to reproduce ab initio forces obtained from condensed phase quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. During the procedure, the MM part of the QM/MM is iteratively improved so as to approach ab initio quality. In this work, the AFM method has been tested to parametrize force fields for liquid water so that the resulting force fields reproduce forces calculated using the ab initio MP2 and the Kohn-Sham density functional theory with the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) and Becke three-parameter LYP (B3LYP) exchange correlation functionals. The AFM force fields generated in this work are very simple to evaluate and are supported by most molecular dynamics (MD) codes. At the same time, the quality of the forces predicted by the AFM force fields rivals that of very expensive ab initio calculations and are found to successfully reproduce many experimental properties. The site-site radial distribution functions (RDFs) obtained from MD simulations using the force field generated from the BLYP functional through AFM compare favorably with the previously published RDFs from Car-Parrinello MD simulations with the same functional. Technical aspects of AFM such as the optimal QM cluster size, optimal basis set, and optimal QM method to be used with the AFM procedure are discussed in this paper.

The new growth method leads to CdSe quantum wells with outstanding optical quality. Their properties are compared to CdSe island structures obtained in a non-migration-enhanced growth mode.

The as-prepared SnS nanoparticles are characterized by optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic analyzes. The direct and indirect band gaps of the QDs are estimated and blue shift is observed for the SnS nanopowder when compared to the bulk material. The low temperature PL spectrum of the SnS nanoparticles is recorded at 35 K and the results are discussed. The scanning electron micrographs (SEM) suggest the presence of size controlled spherical aggregates of smaller as well as larger sizes. The examination of the SnS QDs using transmission electron micrographs (TEM) reveals the predominance of particles with a spherical shape with the average particle size of 3-5 nm. The results obtained from the present work are encouraging in terms of quality of crystallites, size and shape when compared to the previously reported works.

The crystalline quality and surface morphology of In-rich InxGa1-xN films was improved by using InN templates as underlying layers. It was also found that the crystalline quality of In-rich InxGa1-xN was strongly correlated with that of the underlying InN templates. High-quality InN templates with the (0 0 0 2) X-ray rocking curves (XRCs) as narrow as 1 arcmin, have recently been achieved by optimizing the nitridation conditions of (0 0 0 1) sapphire Substrates (300 degrees C, 2 h). These InN templates have provided further improvement of the crystalline quality of In0.8Ga0.2N films. The (0 0 0 2) XRCs for these In0.8Ga0.2N films were approximately 18 arcmin (full-width at half-maximum), dramatically narrower than the 36 arcmin obtained with a previous substrate-nitridation process (550 degrees C, 1 h). By employing these high-quality In0.8Ga0.2N layers as not only growth templates but also bottom barrier layers, an InN/In0.8Ga0.2N multiple quantum well (MQW) structure and single-quantum well (SQW) structures with different well widths were fabricated.

Remarkable improvement of PL intensity and obvious appearance of pendellosung fringes were observed by removing the N ions produced in the plasma cell. When the growth rate increased from 0.73 to 1.2 ML/s, the optimum growth temperature was raised from 460 degreesC to 480 degreesC and PL peak intensity increased two times. Although the N composition decreased with increasing growth rate, degradation of optical properties of GaInNAs QWs was observed when the growth rate was over 0.92 ML/s.

The total PL efficiency is the product of these two factors, for which the optimal annealing temperatures are found to be similar to 700 degrees C and similar to 760 degrees C, respectively, whereas the optimal annealing temperature for the integrated PL intensity is found to be between the two temperatures and equals similar to 720 degrees C.

In this algorithm, the standard binary gravitational search algorithm is modified by applying the concepts and principles of quantum behavior to improve the search capability with a fast convergence rate. QBGSA is integrated with an artificial immune system, which acts as an adaptive element to improve the flexibility of the algorithm toward economic capability while maintaining the quality of the solution and speed. The optimization involves multi-objective functions and handles the observability constraints determined by the concept of the topological monitor reach area. The objective functions are based on the number of required PQM, monitor overlapping index, and sag severity index. The proposed adaptive QBGSA is applied on several test systems, which include both transmission and distribution systems. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive QBGSA method, its performance is compared with that of the conventional binary gravitational search algorithm, binary particle swarm optimization, quantum-inspired binary particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithm.

PbS CQDs were deposited uniformly by electrophoretic method on a TiO2 photoelectrode applying 200 V for 60 min and used as photosensitizers in a TiO2 solar cell. Their photovoltaic parameters were studied under 1 sun illumination.

Quantum dots represent a novel, emission-tunable luminescent material for optimizing the sunlight spectrum in greenhouses with minimal intensity loss, ultimately enabling improved light use efficiency of plant growth without requiring electricity. In this study, greenhouse films containing CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots were utilized to absorb and convert ultraviolet and blue photons from sunlight to a photoluminescent emission centered at 600 nm. To analyze the effects of the quantum dot film spectrum on plant production, a 25-week tomato trial was conducted in Dutch glass greenhouses. Plants under the quantum dot film experienced a 14% reduction in overall daily light integral, resulting from perpendicular photosynthetically active radiation transmission of 85.3%, mainly due to reflection losses. Despite this reduction in intensity, the modified sunlight spectrum and light diffusion provided by the quantum dot film gave rise to 5.7% improved saleable production yield, nearly identical total fruiting biomass production, 23% higher light use efficiency (g/mol), 10% faster vegetative growth rate, and 36% reduced tomato waste compared to the control, which had no additional films. Based on this result, materials incorporating quantum dots show promise in enabling passive, electricity-free spectrum modification for improving crop production in greenhouse cultivation, but extensive controlled crop studies are needed to further validate their effectiveness.",quantum dot; nanotechnology; nanomaterials; greenhouse; spectrum; sunlight; horticulture; tomatoes,"[Hebert, Damon; Parrish, Charles H.; Ramasamy, Karthik; Makarov, Nikolay S.; Castaneda, Chloe; McDaniel, Hunter; Bergren, Matthew R.] UbiQD Inc, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA; [Boonekamp, Jeroen; Schuddebeurs, Lisanne] Delphy Improvement Ctr, Bleiswijk, Netherlands",,"Hebert, D (corresponding author), UbiQD Inc, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA.",damon@ubiqd.com,"McDaniel, Hunter Y/E-9125-2012",,"UbiQD, Inc.","UbiQD, Inc.","The authors declare that this research was supported by funding provided by UbiQD, Inc.

In our scheme, the training sets for a protein are only constructed from its small subsystems, which capture all short-range interactions in the target system. The energy of a given protein is expressed as the summation of atomic contributions from QM calculations of various subsystems, corrected by long-range Coulomb and van der Waals interactions. With the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) method, our protocol can automatically generate training sets with high efficiency. To facilitate the construction of training sets for proteins, we store all trained subsystem data in a library. If subsystems in the library are detected in a new protein, corresponding datasets can be directly reused as a part of the training set on this new protein. With two polypeptides, 4ZNN and 1XQ8 segment, as examples, the energies and forces predicted by GEBF-GAP are in good agreement with those from conventional QM calculations, and dihedral angle distributions from GEBF-GAP molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can also well reproduce those from ab initio MD simulations. In addition, with the training set generated from GEBF-GAP, we also demonstrate that GEBF-ML force fields constructed by neural network (NN) methods can also show QM quality.

Exact control of the arsenic flux during capping helps to reduce the strong group-V As-Sb exchange reactions, enabling the rings to be capped at the same growth temperature (480 degrees C) without dissolution. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy indicate excellent structural quality and uniformity with no threading dislocations. This is due to the reduction in the average strain through the quantum-ring formation. The total ring density in the stacks is 1 x 10(11) cm(-2). An unusually long-wavelength quantum-ring photoluminescence peak of 1.3 mu m is observed at low temperature, which is attributed to a reduction in the quantum-ring charging due to lower unintentional p-doping in the GaAs cap layer.

We developed an economically feasible PbI2 precursor with around 1/20 cost-down for perovskite/perovskite quantum dots through recrystallization and/or hydrothermal purification. Following the methodology, the quantum dots from both as-prepared and purified PbI2 demonstrated identical photophysical properties, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 52.61% using the purified PbI2 vs. 45.83% PLQY using commercial PbI2. The role of hydrothermal energy was also checked against the problematic PbI2, and we checked whether the hydrothermal energy could contribute to the hindrance of undesired particle formation in the precursor solution, which enables them to form enlarged grain size from 179 +/- 80 to 255 +/- 130 nm for higher photoconversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells from 14.77 +/- 1.82% to 15.18 +/- 1.92%.",perovskite; perovskite quantum dots; perovskite solar cells; hydrothermal; perovskite precursor purification,"[Lee, ChaeHyun; Shin, YeJi; Yoon, Seog Joon] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Chem, Coll Nat Sci, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Jeon, Gyeong G.; Kim, Jincheol] Korea Elect Technol Inst, New Renewable Energy Res Ctr, Seong Nam 13509, South Korea; [Kang, Dongwoo; Jung, Jiwon; Jeon, Byeongmin; Park, Jongin] Daegu Sci High Sch, 154 Dongdaegu Ro, Daegu 42110, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Yoon, SJ (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Dept Chem, Coll Nat Sci, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.;Kim, J (corresponding author), Korea Elect Technol Inst, New Renewable Energy Res Ctr, Seong Nam 13509, South Korea.;Park, J (corresponding author), Daegu Sci High Sch, 154 Dongdaegu Ro, Daegu 42110, South Korea.",dwuos@naver.com; aashinyj@naver.com; eastjk2@keti.re.kr; ts19048@ts.hs.kr; ts19078@ts.hs.kr; ts19077@ts.hs.kr; kisses84@ts.hs.kr; jckim@keti.re.kr; yoon@yu.ac.kr,"YOON, SEOG JOON/Y-3925-2018; Kim, Jincheol/O-5037-2015; Kang, Dong-Won/N-3594-2014","YOON, SEOG JOON/0000-0002-8921-9062; Kim, Jincheol/0000-0001-7374-2740; Jeon, Gyeongguk/0000-0003-2463-1299; Kang, Dong-Won/0000-0002-4818-8108",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2019R1F1A1062395]; 2020 Daegu Science High School Self-motivated Research Projects,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT); 2020 Daegu Science High School Self-motivated Research Projects,This work was supported by the 2020 Daegu Science High School Self-motivated Research Projects and National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) 2019R1F1A1062395.

Compared with the original CdTe core QDs, the core/shell CdTe/CdSe QDs exhibit an obvious red-shifted emission, whose color can be tuned between visible and NIR regions (620-740 nm) by controlling the thickness of the CdSe shell. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) of CdTe/CdSe QDs with an optimized thickness of the CdSe shell can reach up to 44.2% without any post-preparative treatment. Through a thorough study of the core/shell structure by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the as-prepared CdTe/CdSe QDs demonstrate good monodispersity, hardened lattice structure and excellent photostability, offering a great potential for biological application.

Here we find such Pb-rich strategies can be avoided by providing additional iodine ions using other metal halide salts. In particular GeI2, which contrary to PbI2, readily dissolves in TOP. CsPbI3 QDs prepared using PbI2/GeI2 combination show near-unity PL QY and improved chemical stability compared to the previous synthetic route. Furthermore, we find no sign of Ge incorporation in the QDs (compositionally or energetically). The ensuing QD solar-cells deliver power conversion efficiency of 12.15% and retain 85% of its peak performance after storage over 90 days. The PbI2/GeI2 dual-source iodine synthetic approach presented here represents a more rational and robust route to high-quality CsPbI3 QDs.",HALIDE PEROVSKITE NANOCRYSTALS; LIGAND-MEDIATED SYNTHESIS; SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION; LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES; COLLOIDAL SYNTHESIS; ELECTRON INJECTION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ANION-EXCHANGE; LEAD,"[Liu, Feng; Ding, Chao; Zhang, Yaohong; Karnisaka, Taichi; Toyoda, Taro; Shen, Qing] Univ Electrocommun, Fac Informat & Engn, 1-5-1 Chofugaoka, Tokyo 1828585, Japan; [Zhao, Qian; Luther, Joseph M.] NREL, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Hayase, Shuzi] Kyushu Inst Technol, Fac Life Sci & Syst Engn, 2-4 Hibikino, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8080196, Japan; [Minemoto, Takashi] Ritsumeikan Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, 1-1-1 Nojihigashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Yoshino, Kenji] Miyazaki Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, 1-1 Gakuen, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; [Zhang, Bing; Dai, Songyuan] North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing Key Lab Novel Thin Film Solar Cells, State Key Lab Alternate Elect Power Syst Renewabl, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Junke; Tao, Shuxia] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Ctr Computat Energy Res, Dept Appl Phys, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Zhao, Qian] Nankai Univ, Coll Chem, Tianjin, Peoples R China",University of Electro-Communications - Japan; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Kyushu Institute of Technology; Ritsumeikan University; University of Miyazaki; North China Electric Power University; Eindhoven University of Technology; Nankai University,"Shen, Q (corresponding author), Univ Electrocommun, Fac Informat & Engn, 1-5-1 Chofugaoka, Tokyo 1828585, Japan.;Dai, S (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing Key Lab Novel Thin Film Solar Cells, State Key Lab Alternate Elect Power Syst Renewabl, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",sydai@ncepu.edu.cn; shen@pc.uec.ac.jp,"Zhang, Can/JUU-9511-2023; Zhao, Qian/AHA-5793-2022; Minemoto, Takashi/F-9342-2011; Ding, Chao/ABB-1760-2020; Ding, Chao/ABY-5504-2022; Zhang, Yaohong/D-7006-2018; Luther, Joseph/Y-2782-2019; LIU, Feng/IYJ-0182-2023","Zhao, Qian/0000-0001-6939-3568; Ding, Chao/0000-0003-3509-2219; Ding, Chao/0000-0003-3509-2219; Zhang, Yaohong/0000-0001-7789-4784; LIU, Feng/0000-0002-0317-3455; Liu, Feng/0000-0002-6903-6840; Luther, Joseph/0000-0002-4054-8244; Tao, Shuxia/0000-0002-3658-8497; Yoshino, Kenji/0000-0002-0438-6030; Dai, Songyuan/0000-0001-5710-9208","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST program; JST PRESTO program; MEXT KAKENHI [26286013, 17H02736]; Faculty of Informatics and Engineering, UEC; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program at NREL; China Scholarship Council","Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST program; JST PRESTO program; MEXT KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Faculty of Informatics and Engineering, UEC; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program at NREL; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","This research was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST program, JST PRESTO program, the MEXT KAKENHI Grant (Grant Nos. 26286013, 17H02736), JSPS International Research Fellow (Faculty of Informatics and Engineering, UEC).

For high transition temperature (high-T-c) rf SQUID, dielectric resonator is presently one of the most practical tank circuits. By growing YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) superconducting thin film on (100) SrTiO3 substrate with a pulsed-laser deposition technique and then patterning the YBCO thin film into flux concentrator with a washer structure, a series of dielectric resonators with unloaded quality factor Q(0) ranging from 200 to 6000 has been prepared. Surface morphology and electrical transport measurements have been carried out to investigate the dependence of Q(0) on the property of the YBCO thin film, which suggests that it is effective to boost the Q(0) of the resonator through improvements in both the crystalline quality and the superconductivity of the thin film. By integrating the resonators with the same SQUID chip, a set of YBCO rf SQUIDs has been assembled to explore the influence of Q(0) of the resonator on the performance of the rf SQUID. It is observed that the white noise of the device decreases substantially with the increase of Q(0), in accordance with the theoretical suggestion. Moreover, as Q(0) rises, the low frequency noise of the device is shown to reduce as well, revealing the importance of the high-Q(0) resonator in depressing the noise of the high-T-c rf SQUID over the entire frequency range. With the resonator of Q(0) = 6000, the YBCO rf SQUID at 77 K exhibits a field sensitivity of 50 fT/Hz(1/2) in the white noise region, 58 fT/Hz(1/2) and 110 fT/Hz(1/2) at 10 Hz and 1 Hz respectively, suggesting its potential in applications such as magnetoencephalography in biomagnetism which have critical requirements on field sensitivity of the high-T-c SQUID especially at low frequencies.",YBa2Cu3O7-delta; rf SQUID; Dielectric resonator; Quality factor; Magnetic field sensitivity,"[Li, Yu-Long; Xu, Tie-Quan; Wang, Hong-Zhang; Linghu, Ke-Huan; Huang, Zi-Geng; Nie, Rui-Juan; Wang, Yue; Wang, Fu-Ren; Gan, Zi-Zhao] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Appl Superconduct Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Yu-Long; Xu, Tie-Quan; Wang, Hong-Zhang; Linghu, Ke-Huan; Huang, Zi-Geng; Nie, Rui-Juan; Wang, Yue; Wang, Fu-Ren; Gan, Zi-Zhao] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, State Key Lab Mesoscop Phys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Appl Superconduct Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Wang, Y (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, State Key Lab Mesoscop Phys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yue.wang@pku.edu.cn; frwang@pku.edu.cn,"Zhang, Xiaofeng/JMC-6060-2023; Cheng, Yuan/JKJ-0794-2023; cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023; Wang, Yue/E-9002-2010; xin, liang/JFS-5770-2023; zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023; CHEN, WENJIE/JQW-1608-2023; wang, yue/ISA-4119-2023; wang, yingying/JSK-6741-2023; Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020; XU, tiequan/GPS-7956-2022","Zhang, Xiaofeng/0000-0003-2738-3286; Wang, Jiacheng/0000-0003-4327-1508; XU, tiequan/0000-0002-6167-0994; Wang, Yue/0000-0001-5955-0814",,,,,31,2,2,2,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-4534,1873-2143,,PHYSICA C,Physica C,JAN 15,2023,604,,,,,,,,1354178,10.1016/j.physc.2022.1354178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physc.2022.1354178,,DEC 2022,7,"Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,7A7UN,,,,,2024-03-31,WOS:000898656400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

High-dimensional QKD (HDQKD) not only increases the secret key rate but also tolerates higher quantum bit error rate (QBER). Many HDQKD experiments have been realized by utilizing orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) photons as the degree of freedom (DOF) of OAM of the photon is a prospective resource for HD quantum information. In this work, we propose that a high-quality HDQKD based on polarization-OAM hybrid states can be realized by utilizing state mapping between different DOFs and we characterize this HDQKD.

Our experiment verifies that a 0.60% +/- 0.06% QBER and a 1.849 +/- 0.008-bit secret key rate per sifted signal can be achieved for a four-dimensional QKD with the weak coherent light source and decoy state method.",ORBITAL ANGULAR-MOMENTUM; VECTOR BEAMS; LIGHT-BEAMS; INFORMATION; SECURITY; FIBER,"[Wang, Fang-Xiang; Chen, Wei; Yin, Zhen-Qiang; Wang, Shuang; Guo, Guang-Can; Han, Zheng-Fu] Univ Sci & Technol China, CAS Key Lab Quantum Informat, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fang-Xiang; Chen, Wei; Yin, Zhen-Qiang; Wang, Shuang; Guo, Guang-Can; Han, Zheng-Fu] Univ Sci & Technol China, Synerget Innovat Ctr Quantum Informat & Quantum P, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fang-Xiang; Chen, Wei; Yin, Zhen-Qiang; Wang, Shuang; Guo, Guang-Can; Han, Zheng-Fu] State Key Lab Cryptol, POB 5159, Beijing 100878, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; CAS Center for Excellence in Quantum Information & Quantum Physics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; CAS Center for Excellence in Quantum Information & Quantum Physics","Chen, W (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, CAS Key Lab Quantum Informat, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Chen, W (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Synerget Innovat Ctr Quantum Informat & Quantum P, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Chen, W (corresponding author), State Key Lab Cryptol, POB 5159, Beijing 100878, Peoples R China.",weich@ustc.edu.cn; yinzq@ustc.edu.cn,"Wang, Shuang/K-9522-2014; wang, xueting/JPY-2782-2023; Chen, Wei/AAH-9154-2020","Wang, Shuang/0000-0003-1822-1613; Wang, Fang-Xiang/0000-0003-2665-3440","National Key Research And Development Program of China [2016YFA0302600]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61627820, 61775207, 61675189, 61622506, 61475148, 61575183]; Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies",National Key Research And Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies,"The authors acknowledge Martin P.

These effects are observed over long time-scales exceeding several minutes at low temperatures. By varying the optical excitation energy and power and temperature we show that these effects arise from carriers photogenerated by interband excitation which are trapped in random potential fluctuations in the quantum wells related to compositional fluctuations. Effects related to defect levels in the band gap can be excluded and a transition of the conduction mechanism with temperature from a hopping to a percolation regime is observed. The transition temperature observed for our quantum well material is strongly reduced compared to bulk crystals. This indicates a superior structural quality giving rise to only weak potential fluctuation of less than or similar to 3 meV. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Due to very low efficiency of the spontaneous emission resulting from the intersubband transitions in QC structures, it is still challenging to achieve milliwatts superluminescence under quasi-continuous wave condition at room temperature. In this work, we have developed a compact design of similar to 5 mu m SLEs which combines an inclined ridge waveguide with a J shaped waveguide, with a cavity suppression section introduced at the rear end and a straight part at the front end. This design enables the fabrication of longer devices without using greater chip area, and the fabricated SLEs exhibit a large output power of 2.2 mW and a low coherence length of about 40 mu m. Moreover, the characteristic temperature T-0 of 207 K reveals excellent temperature stability of the devices, and the far-field emission at the angle of 0 degrees exhibits a single transverse mode without any side lobes, which indicates a high optical quality of the emission beam.

More importantly, the new well-established protocols are easy to apply to large-scale synthesis; around 37 g ZnxCd1-xS/ZnS core/shell QDs can be easily synthesized in one batch reaction. Highly efficient deep-blue quantum dot-based light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) are demonstrated by employing the ZnxCd1-xS/ZnS core/shell QDs as emitters.

QD properties were studied by reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. All structures were prepared by low pressure metal organic vapor phase epitaxy. Concerning the lower interface, a good epitaxial surface planarity is required for QD formation with high QD density and narrow size distribution. Therefore the growth conditions of the QD buffer layer are very important. We demonstrate the improvement of the QD size distribution and homogeneity, when the growth rate of the buffer layer was decreased. The upper QD interface is formed during the covering process. InAs quantum dots were capped by GaAs or by GaAsSb. The presence of Sb atoms in covering layer strongly influences the interface abruptness. In the case of GaAs covering layer, an InGaAs layer with gradual decrease of In concentration is unintentionally formed at the interface between InAs and GaAs. The presence of Sb in GaAsSb covering layer helps to form abrupt interface between InAs and covering layer. However, enhanced surfacting of In atoms was observed for GaAsSb SRL. An optimal GaAsSb composition profile is suggested to prevent dissolution of QDs during the covering process and to minimize the amount of surfacting In atoms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are only a few reports on CH3NH3PbX3 QLEDs and the reported performance is still very poor, primarily due to the difficulties in the fabrication of high-quality compact QDs thin films. In this work, an electric-field-assisted strategy is developed for efficient fabrication of uniform CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs thin films with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY, 80%-90%) from dilute CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs suspensions (approximate to 0.1 mg mL(-1)) within 5 mins.

Furthermore, a current efficiency of 12.7 cd A(-1), a power efficiency of 9.7 lm W-1, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.2% were acheived by enhancing the hole injection.

Catalpa fruit pericarp (CFP) is often neglected due to the cracking after drying. In order to further investigate the value of CFP, this study proposed to develop a spectral and thermal analysis strategy to evaluate the quality of CFP for the first time. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet (UV) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) original fingerprints (OFPs) of 15 batches of CFP samples were established, and then, they were transformed into continuous peaks to obtain quantum fingerprints (QFPs), respectively. The correlation of P-m between the OFPs and QFPs was good (Pearson's r > 0.9998), which could be inferred that QFPs had a promising application potential in quantitative analysis of TCM. Furthermore, based on the systematically quantified fingerprint method, the above three kinds of QFPs were fused in equal masses to prevent the error caused by a single technology. It was worth noting that different fingerprint techniques yielded varied evaluation results for CFP samples, and the fusion results showed that samples quality was within grade 5.

We have found compositional fluctuations in all the GaInNAs samples, which vary from negligible to very strong over the temperature range studied (360-460 degreesC). In comparison, at the same growth temperature, GaInAs heterostructures appear more homogeneous. It is proposed therefore that the introduction of N in the structure could be responsible for the enhanced phase separation. A broadening of the photoluminescence peak in GaInNAs structures when raising the growth temperature has also been found associated with the increase in composition fluctuations. Moreover, a kinetically limited Stranski-Krastanow growth mode has been observed in both GaInAs and GaInNAs structures, taking place at lower temperature in GaInNAs quantum wells. We suggest that the enhancement of this growth mode is a consequence of the increased phase separation.

The influences of reactor pressure, V/III ratio, growth temperature, and substrate orientation on the quality of InAlGaAs QWs were studied using high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD), photoluminescence (PL) and atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements. The PL results indicate that the PL intensity and full width at the half-maximum (FWHM) of QWs are very sensitive to the growth conditions such as reactor pressure, growth temperature, and substrate orientation. The AFM results demonstrate that the growth mode of epilayer is dominated by the orientation of substrate.

In order to apply it to quantum communication protocol and quantum radar, the entanglement between two spatially separated subsystems, namely dual-path entangled quantum microwave is needed. However, for the circuit that generates the entangled quantum microwave, there is no suitable method to indicate whether the quality of the entangled microwave signal is good or not. Aiming at this problem, we put forward a method of evaluating the quality of dual-path entangled quantum microwave signals generated based on von Neumann entropy. The origin of the entangled quantum microwave is that vacuum state signals are transformed into squeezed state signals in driven pump, so in this paper we use a two-mode squeezed vacuum state to describe the formation of dual-path entangled quantum microwave signal, thus providing the function relation between the photon number and the squeezed parameter. In a communication system, the signal-noise ratio is usually used to express the reliability of system. Entropy is a measure of disorder degree in information. If both of them can be made the analogy, the entropy is used to evaluate the proportion of entangled state signals, the quality of original signals will be evaluated and the relationship among the entropy and squeezed parameter and the photon number will be analyzed. The simulation results show that the photon number in the entangled quantum microwave signal is determined by the squeezed parameter, and there is an index change with the square rule between them. Entropy decreases with the increase of squeezed parameter: its minimum value is 0, and its maximum value can be found from 0.9 to 1. The slope of curve is steep near the maximum, which reflects that the influence of squeezed parameter on the degree of entanglement is obvious, and that the range of optimal value choices in squeezed parameter is very narrow. The optimal value of squeezed parameter is dependent on photon number; it increases with the increase of the photon number. Entropy tends to decrease smoothly with the increase of squeezed parameter and it approximately has a negative exponent relation. The photon number in an actual signal is limited, so the limit value of entropy is estimated to be about 65%. The research shows that the quality of the entangled microwave signal can be improved by choosing appropriate squeezed parameter in different circuits that generate dual-path entangled quantum microwave signals for meeting the actual needs. Therefore, the research can provide the method of choosing the parameters of dual-path entangled quantum microwave circuit and improve the availability of system.",entangled quantum microwave; von Neumann entropy; squeezed parameter; photon number,"[Li Xiang; Wu De-Wei; Wang Xi; Miao Qiang; Chen Kun; Yang Chun-Yan] Air Force Engn Univ, Sch Informat & Nav, Xian 710077, Peoples R China",Air Force Engineering University,"Wu, DW (corresponding author), Air Force Engn Univ, Sch Informat & Nav, Xian 710077, Peoples R China.",wudewei74609@126.com,,"Li, Xiang/0000-0001-6433-9968",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61573372],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61573372).,,24,3,3,1,10,CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC,BEIJING,"P O BOX 603, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-3290,,,ACTA PHYS SIN-CH ED,Acta Phys.

First, the Taguchi orthogonal array (L27)(3(5)) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to determine the factors crucial to surface roughness: the feedrate, spindle speed and cutting depth. Response surface methodology (RSM) was then used to construct prediction models for the surface roughness characteristics R-a,R- R-max and R-z. Finally, an MOQPSO algorithm was used to solve the multiobjective optimisation problem. The results show that the surface roughness quality generated using this algorithm is superior to that produced in non-optimal conditions, Taguchi method and traditional multiobjective particle swarm optimisation.

The nanowires employed are 50-80 nm in diameter and the QDs are defined in the nanowires between the source and drain contacts on a Si/SiO2 substrate. We show that highly tunable QD devices can be realized with the MBE-grown InSb nanowires and the gate-to-dot capacitance extracted in the many-electron regimes is scaled linearly with the longitudinal dot size, demonstrating that the devices are of single InSb nanowire QDs even with a longitudinal size of similar to 700 nm. In the few-electron regime, the quantum levels in the QDs are resolved and the Lande g-factors extracted for the quantum levels from the magnetotransport measurements are found to be strongly level-dependent and fluctuated in a range of 18-48. A spin-orbit coupling strength is extracted from the magnetic field evolutions of a ground state and its neighboring excited state in an InSb nanowire QD and is on the order of similar to 300 mu eV. Our results establish that the MBE-grown InSb nanowires are of high crystal quality and are promising for the use in constructing novel quantum devices, such as entangled spin qubits, one-dimensional Wigner crystals and topological quantum computing devices.",BIAS CONDUCTANCE PEAK; SEMICONDUCTOR NANOWIRE; HYBRID DEVICE; GIANT; SPINS,"[Fan, Dingxun; Li, Sen; Kang, N.; Wang, L.

Herein, an effective way to fabricate nanostructures- whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) lasers by drop-casting CdSe/CdS@Cd1-xZnxS core/buffer-shell@graded-shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) dispersion onto silica microspheres is presented. Benefiting from the excellent gain properties from the interface engineered core/hybrid shell NPLs and high-quality factor WGM resonator from excellent optical field confinement, the proposed room-temperature NPLs-WGM microlasers show a record-low lasing threshold of 3.26 mu J cm(-2) under nanosecond laser pumping among all colloidal NPLs-based lasing demonstrations. The presence of sharp discrete transverse electric- and magnetic-mode spikes, the inversely proportional dependence of the free spectra range on microsphere sizes and the polarization anisotropy of laser output represent the first direct experimental evidence for NPLs-WGM lasing nature, which is verified theoretically by the computed electric-field distribution inside the microcavity. Remarkably, a stable single-mode lasing output with an ultralow lasing threshold of 3.84 mu J cm(-2) is achieved by the Vernier effect through evanescent field coupling. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.",colloidal quantum wells; compositional engineering; monolithic microcavities; single-mode lasing; ultralow threshold lasing; whispering gallery modes,"[Duan, Rui; Zhang, Zitong; Xiao, Lian; Thung, Yi Tian; Van Duong Ta; Sun, Handong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Duan, Rui] Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Phys & Optoelect Engn, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiaoxu; Liu, Zheng] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Ding, Lu] ASTAR, Inst Mat Res & Engn, Singapore 138634, Singapore; [Liu, Zheng] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Liu, Zheng] CINTRA CNRS NTU THALES, UMI 3288, Singapore 637553, Singapore; [Yang, Jun] Guangdong Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Informat Photon Technol, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Van Duong Ta] Le Quy Don Tech Univ, Dept Opt Devices, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam",Nanyang Technological University; Harbin Engineering University; Nanyang Technological University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of Materials Research & Engineering (IMRE); Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Guangdong University of Technology; Le Quy Don Technical University,"Ta, VD; Sun, HD (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore 637371, Singapore.;Yang, J (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Informat Photon Technol, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.;Ta, VD (corresponding author), Le Quy Don Tech Univ, Dept Opt Devices, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.",yangj@gdut.edu.cn; duong.ta@lqdtu.edu.vn; hdsun@ntu.edu.sg,"Zhao, Xiaoxu/G-4114-2013; Yang, jun/G-4446-2014; Zhao, Xiaoxu/HKN-8442-2023; Ta, Duong/C-5591-2018; Sun, Handong/A-2940-2010","Zhao, Xiaoxu/0000-0001-9746-3770; Zhao, Xiaoxu/0000-0001-9746-3770; DUAN, RUI/0009-0006-9197-5728; Sun, Handong/0000-0002-2261-7103","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China [61925501]; Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams [2019ZT08X340]; Introducing Leading Talents of The Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program of Guangdong Province [2019CX01X010]; Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [03INS000973C150]; Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 3 Programme Geometrical Quantum Materials AcRF Tier 3 [MOE2018-T3-1-002]; Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 3 Programme Geometrical Quantum Materials AcRF Tier 1 [RG7/18]; [NRF-CRP21-2018-0007]; [NRF-CRP23-2019-0007]; [AME-IRG- A20E5c0083]; [NRF2020-NRF-ISF004-3520]","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams; Introducing Leading Talents of The Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program of Guangdong Province; Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 3 Programme Geometrical Quantum Materials AcRF Tier 3; Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 3 Programme Geometrical Quantum Materials AcRF Tier 1; ; ; ;","R.D. and Z.T.Z. contributed equally to this work.

Herein, CdSe colloidal quantum dots (QDs) serve as crystallization seeds for the first time to modulate the nucleation and crystal growth processes simultaneously of the CsPbl(2)Br film in the ambient environment. As additives, CdSe QDs help promote the nucleation process in the initial stage of perovskite formation. In addition, it is revealed that the surface ligands of QDs also have an essential influence on the subsequent crystal growth of the perovskite film. The bifunctional ligands on the surface of QDs are beneficial in delaying the growth process of perovskite due to the free functional groups at the ends. The CsPbl 2 Br film prepared with bifunctional organic ligand-capped CdSe QD additives shows better crystallinity than that of the inorganic ligand-based one due to the dual function of these kinds of QDs in not only promoting nucleation but also retarding crystal growth of CsPbl(2)Br crystals. As a result, the high-quality CsPbl(2)Br film with a low defect state density is prepared in the ambient environment. The optimized efficiency of the assembled hole-conductorfree carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) is increased from 12.73% to 14.49%, which is one of the best results for all-inorganic C-PSCs.",all-inorganic perovskites; carbon electrodes; ligands; quantum dot additives; solar cells,"[Xu, Shuaihang; Kang, Cuiting; Huang, Zhaoshuai; Zhang, Zhengyan; Rao, Huashang; Pan, Zhenxiao; Zhong, Xinhua] South China Agr Univ, Coll Mat & Energy, Key Lab Biobased Mat & Energy, Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China; [Rao, Huashang; Pan, Zhenxiao; Zhong, Xinhua] Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture,"Rao, HS; Pan, ZX (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Mat & Energy, Key Lab Biobased Mat & Energy, Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China.;Rao, HS; Pan, ZX (corresponding author), Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China.",raohsh@scau.edu.cn; zxpan@scau.edu.cn,"WANG, Bin/JGM-2639-2023; åå, é¥¶/HMV-8255-2023; Tan, Wei/KBB-7333-2024; Han, Jian/ABZ-1060-2022; ZHONG, Xinhua/HGE-6801-2022; cheng, shu/IZE-4788-2023","Han, Jian/0000-0002-0647-4050; ZHONG, Xinhua/0000-0002-2062-8773;","Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture Project [NZ2021030]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51732004, 22122805, 22075090, 21975083]",Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"S.X. and C.K. contributed equally to this work.

This paper presents a method to improve the power quality (PQ) and reliability of distribution systems by employing optimal NR. Optimal NR is applied independently to a system in a specified period to minimize the number of propagated voltage sags (N-sag) and other reliability indexes such as the average system interruption frequency index, sustained average interruption frequency index, and momentary average interruption frequency index. The quantum-inspired binary firefly algorithm (QBFA) is used to find the optimal NR. The QBFA performance for the application of optimal NR to minimize N-sag is first compared with other established optimization methods such as the standard binary firefly algorithm and gravitational search algorithm. Case studies are conducted by using other objective functions, and reliability assessment is performed to observe the reliability improvement caused by the new network topology.

We here report an approach to synthesize high quality green emitting quaternary alloyed CdSeZnS quantum dots (QDs) with a hot-injection method. The quantum yield (QY) of as-synthesized ZnCdSSe QD cores is up to 84% with single-exponential PL decay dynamics. After overcoating 4 mono-layers (MLs) ZnS on the ZnCdSSe cores, the resultant ZnCdSSe/ZnS QDs reaches a PL QY as high as 96% at 520 nm and narrow emission spectra (full width at half maximum, FWHM <20 nm). The ZnCdSSe/ZnS QDs are used to fabricate green light emitting diodes (GLEDs) with a 390 nm chip as the backlight. The best GLEDs show bright green light, excellent color purity, and high luminous stability. Such excellent performance is attributed to a high nucleation temperature at 330 degrees C and the precisely controlled ZnS shells of CdSeZnS/ZnS QDs, which can effectively suppress Auger recombination (AR). This study suggests that the precise nucleation and shell engineering of QDs may provide an effective means to meet requirements for practical display and lighting applications.",Quarternary-alloyed; ZnCdSSe; ZnS quantum dots; Single photoluminescence decay channel; High devise stability,"[Xu, Bing; Zhang, Tingting; Li, Dongyu; Zhang, Zhenghe; Huang, Zhen; Li, Qinghua; Jin, Xiao] Lingnan Normal Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Dev & Educ Special Needs C, Zhanjiang 524048, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bing; Zhang, Tingting; Li, Dongyu; Zhang, Zhenghe; Huang, Zhen; Li, Qinghua; Jin, Xiao] Lingnan Normal Univ, Key Lab Environmentally Friendly Funct Mat & Devi, Zhanjiang 524048, Peoples R China; [Chen, Haibin; Long, Qing; Huang, Lishu] Lingnan Normal Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Zhanjiang 524048, Peoples R China",LingNan Normal University; LingNan Normal University; LingNan Normal University,"Jin, X (corresponding author), Lingnan Normal Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Dev & Educ Special Needs C, Zhanjiang 524048, Peoples R China.",jinx@lingnan.edu.cn,"Li, Dongyu/ACT-2527-2022; zhang, ting/IYT-0642-2023; Zhang, Tingting/HDN-5850-2022; Li, Qing-Hua/L-5603-2018","Li, Dongyu/0000-0001-8338-0536; Li, Qing-Hua/0000-0003-3125-1024; Xu, Bing/0000-0002-7385-9954","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61705095]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2021A1515012292, 2020A1414010234, 2019A1515011228, 2019A1515011461]; Program of Young Creative Talents in Universities of Guangdong Province [2018KQNCX153]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20192ACBL21045]; Innovation Team of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes [2019KCXT012]; Key Projects in Universities of Guangdong Province [2019KZDZX2008, 2020ZDZX3034, 2020ZDZX2055]; Science and Technology Program of Zhanjiang [2020B01043, 2020A03003]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Program of Young Creative Talents in Universities of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); Innovation Team of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes; Key Projects in Universities of Guangdong Province; Science and Technology Program of Zhanjiang,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61705095), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2021A1515012292, 2020A1414010234, 2019A1515011228, 2019A1515011461), Program of Young Creative Talents in Universities of Guangdong Province (2018KQNCX153), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (20192ACBL21045), Innovation Team of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes (2019KCXT012), Key Projects in Universities of Guangdong Province (2019KZDZX2008, 2020ZDZX3034, 2020ZDZX2055), Science and Technology Program of Zhanjiang (2020B01043, 2020A03003).",,34,4,4,2,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-2313,1872-7883,,J LUMIN,J.

The synthesis was performed in the open air by mixing precursors cadmium stearate and S powder into a new solvent N-oleoylmorpholine. An overlapped nucleation-growth stage followed by a dominated growth stage was observed. The resulting QDs exhibited well-resolved absorption fine substructure and a dominant band-edge emission with a narrow size distribution (the full width at half maximum (fwhm) was only 22-24 nm). The maximum photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) was as high as 46.5%. Highly monodispersed CdS QDs with tunable sizes and similar PL fwhm and QYs could also be obtained from the CdS QDs in a large-scale synthesis. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern suggested that the as-prepared QDs with high crystallinity had a cubic structure. A significant PL improvement and a continuous QY increase for the CdS QDs were observed during a long storage time in air and in a glovebox under room temperature. A slow surface reconstruction was proposed to be the cause for the PL enhancement of CdS QDs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The paper indicator coated with G-CQD showed discoloration from pale yellow to reddish brown according to pH 2-12 adjustment, and ammonia in the range of 0.1-250 mu M could be detected. As an indicator of spoilage, the indicator's ability to indicate the quality of fish and shrimp was evaluated during storage at 28 & DEG;C for 24 h. A noticeable variation in the color of the packing indicator from light yellow to dark brown (fish) and blackish brown (shrimp) was observed concurrently with a rise in total volatile basic nitrogen and a pH change of the packaged sample. The G-CQD-based indicators can be a simple and inexpensive approach for suppliers and customers to visually assess the freshness of fish and shrimp in their supply chain.",pH indicator; NH3 sensing; Carbon dots; Spoilage detection; Fish and shrimp freshness,"[Khan, Ajahar; Ezati, Parya; Rhim, Jong-Whan] Kyung Hee Univ, BioNanocomposite Res Ctr, Dept Food & Nutr, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Ezati, Parya] Urmia Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg & Qual Control, Orumiyeh 1177, Iran",Kyung Hee University; Urmia University,"Rhim, JW (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, BioNanocomposite Res Ctr, Dept Food & Nutr, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",jwrhim@khu.ac.kr,"Ezati, Parya/AAH-4696-2019",,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korean government (MSIT) [2022R1A2B5B02001422],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (2022R1A2B5B02001422),,54,1,1,11,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1935-5130,1935-5149,,FOOD BIOPROCESS TECH,Food Bioprocess Technol.,FEB,2024,17,2,,,,,554,569,,10.1007/s11947-023-03154-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-023-03154-6,,JUL 2023,16,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,GJ5Q0,,,,,2024-03-31,WOS:001020279600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

High-performance emissivity of InP QDs has been achievable mostly from the use of an extremely hazardous, reactive P reagent of silylphosphine, thus demanding a search for safer, moderately reactive P precursors such as aminophosphine. Photoluminescence (PL) performances of aminophosphine-derived InP QDs become comparable to those of state-of-the-art silylphosphine-based ones particularly in green color, but this is not true for red color. In this work, we synthesize aminophosphine-based red InP QDs by adopting an unconventional In precursor of InBr3 instead of InCl3 and examine the effect of the type of surface halide, revealing that bromide is more advantageous in suppressing the surface oxidation and thus attains a brighter emissivity over chloride. Subsequently, a further improvement of InBr3-based red InP QDs toward deeper, narrower emissivity is demonstrated by the thickening of the ZnSe inner shell, resulting in a PL peak wavelength of 621 nm and bandwidth of 44 nm along with a quantum yield of 86%.

By varying the trimethylgallium (TMG) flow rate, Mg doping, and growth temperature, it was verified that the TMG supply and growth temperature were the dominant parameters in the control of the p-GaN shape on NWs Specifically, a sufficiently high TMG supply enabled the formation of a pyramid-shaped NW structure with a uniform p-GaN shell. The ratio of the growth rate between the c- and m-planes on the NWs was calculated to be approximately 0.4545. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization confirmed that no clear extended defects were present in the n-GaN core and MQS/p-GaN shells on the sidewall. Regarding the p-GaN shell above the c-plane MQS region, only a few screw dislocations and Frank-type partial dislocations appeared at the interface between the serpentine c-plane MQS and the p-GaN shell near the tips. This suggested that the crystalline quality of the MQS structure can trigger the formation of screw dislocations and Frank-type partial dislocations during the p-GaN growth. The growth mechanism of the p-GaN shell on NWs was also discussed. To inspect the electronic properties, a prototype of a micro light-emitting diode (LED) with a chip size of 50 X 50 mu m(2) was demonstrated in the NWs with optimal growth.

Owing to their unique chemical and physical properties, QDs offer huge potential for lighting applications. Nevertheless, both emission stability and processability of the QDs are limited upon usage from solution. Incorporating them into a solid ionic matrix overcomes both of these drawbacks, while preserving the initial optical properties. Here borax (Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O) is used as a host matrix because of its lower solubility and thereby reduced ionic strength in water in comparison with NaCl. This guarantees the stability of high-quality CdSe/ZnS QDs in the aqueous phase during crystallization and results in a 3.4 times higher loading amount of QDs within the borax crystals compared to NaCl. All steps from the synthesis via mixed crystal preparation to the warm-white LED preparation are verified by applying the model-experimental feedback, in which experimental data and numerical results provide feedback to each other recursively. These measures are taken to ensure a high luminous efficacy of optical radiation (LER) and a high color rendering index (CRI) of the final device as well as a correlated color temperature (CCT) comparable to an incandescent bulb. By doing so, a warm-white LED with a LER of 341 lm/W-opt a CCT of 2720 K and a CRI of 91.1 is produced. Finally, we show that the emission stability of the QDs within the borax crystals on LEDs driven at high currents is significantly improved. These findings indicate that the proposed warm-white light-emitting diodes based on QDs-in-borax hold great promise for quality lighting.",white LEDs; color conversion; mixed crystals; quantum dots; composites; colloidal nanocrystals,"[Adam, Marcus; Stachowski, Gordon M.; Lox, Josephine F.

The QWs have been grown on GaAs:Si substrates having orientations of both (100) and (100)-10 degrees off toward the nearest [110]. We have employed both InAlP ternary alloy cladding layers and specially designed InAlP-InGaP superlattice barrier (SLB) cladding layers. The 4.2 K and 300 K photoluminescence (PL) emission from both the InGaP QW and the InAlP/InGaP SLB heterostructures exhibits very narrow line widths and high intensities, indicating that these structures have relatively smooth interfaces and that they are of high quality. While studies of InAlGaP injection lasers using similar SLBs have been published previously, to our knowledge, detailed photoluminescence studies of ternary/ternary SLBs in the InAlGaP system have not been reported. We have performed calculations of the performance of InAlP/InGaP ternary SLBs and these calculations show that an optimum QW heterobarrier can be achieved for an all-ternary SLB consisting of 10 pairs of InAlP (similar to 1.7 nm) and InGaP (similar to 0.9 nm) and an InAlP ''first barrier layer'' similar to 20 nm thick. Emissions from the InGaP wells grown on off-orientation substrates appear to have narrower linewidths and higher intensities in the InGaP/InAlP system as was previously demonstrated for the InGaP/InAlGaP system.

Herein, liquid-phase-exfoliated black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) are incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution as additives to direct the formation of the perovskite film, i.e., methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)). It is found that the perovskite films made with BPQDs have higher crystallinity and less nonradiative detects compared with the pristine ones, leading to longer carrier lifetime and higher carrier collection efficiency. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectra and surface density calculation of BPQDs reveal that the improvement of the perovskite film quality may be related to the heterogeneous nucleation of the perovskite film at the BPQDs. PVSCs using MAPbI(3) films made with BPQDs achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency of 20.0% and an encouraging thermal stability of T-80 = 100 h at 100 degrees C. Both values are remarkably higher than the devices with pristine perovskite films.

The effect of the low temperature GaAs as cap layers for the QWs was studied by atomic force microscopy and by reflection high energy electron diffraction observations of the growing surface. New features in the (2 x 2) reconstruction were observed whilst growing at low temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere in the chamber, possibly due to competition between As and N species on the surface.

Investigated structures have application relevance due to emission in the 3rd telecommunication window. The nanostructures are grown by ripening-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. This leads to their unique properties, i.e., low spatial density and in-plane shape symmetry. These are advantageous for non-classical light generation for quantum technologies applications. As a measure of the internal quantum efficiency, the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally determined photon extraction efficiency is used. The investigated nanostructures exhibit close to ideal emission efficiency proving their high structural quality. The thermal stability of emission is investigated by means of microphotoluminescence. This allows to determine the maximal operation temperature of the device and reveal the main emission quenching channels. Emission quenching is predominantly caused by the transition of holes and electrons to higher QD's levels. Additionally, these carriers could further leave the confinement potential via the dense ladder of QD states. Single QD emission is observed up to temperatures of about 100 K, comparable to the best results obtained for epitaxial QDs in this spectral range. The fundamental limit for the emission rate is the excitation radiative lifetime, which spreads from below 0.5 to almost 1.9 ns (GHz operation) without any clear spectral dispersion. Furthermore, carrier dynamics is also determined using time-correlated single-photon counting.",MBE growth; symmetric InAs/InP quantum dots; 3rd telecom window; internal quantum efficiency; carrier dynamics; thermal stability of emission; time-correlated single-photon counting,"[Smolka, Tristan; Posmyk, Katarzyna; Wasiluk, Maja; Wyborski, Pawel; Mrowinski, Pawel; Mikulicz, Monika; Zielinska, Agata; Musial, Anna] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Expt Phys, Lab Opt Spect Nanostruct, Wybrzeze Wyspianskiego 27, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland; [Gawelczyk, Michal] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Theoret Phys, Wybrzeze Wyspianskiego 27, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland; [Gawelczyk, Michal] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Toru, Fac Phys Astron & Informat, Inst Phys, Ul Grudzi Dzka 5, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Reithmaier, Johann Peter; Benyoucef, Mohamed] Univ Kassel, Ctr Interdisciplinary Nanostruct Sci & Technol CI, Inst Nanostruct Technol & Analyt INA, Heinrich Plett Str 40, D-34132 Kassel, Germany",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology; Wroclaw University of Science & Technology; Nicolaus Copernicus University; Universitat Kassel,"Musial, A (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Expt Phys, Lab Opt Spect Nanostruct, Wybrzeze Wyspianskiego 27, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.;Benyoucef, M (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Ctr Interdisciplinary Nanostruct Sci & Technol CI, Inst Nanostruct Technol & Analyt INA, Heinrich Plett Str 40, D-34132 Kassel, Germany.",tristan.smolka@pwr.edu.pl; katarzyna.posmyk@student.pwr.edu.pl; 245005@student.pwr.edu.pl; pawel.wyborski@pwr.edu.pl; michal.gawelczyk@pwr.edu.pl; pawel.mrowinski@pwr.edu.pl; monika.mikulicz@pwr.edu.pl; 236442@student.pwr.edu.pl; jpreith@ina.uni-kassel.de; anna.musial@pwr.edu.pl; m.benyoucef@physik.uni-kassel.de,"Reithmaier, Johann P/G-8171-2012; Benyoucef, Mohamed/AAK-6244-2021; GaweÅczyk, MichaÅ/H-3144-2017; SmoÅka, Tristan/KCL-3495-2024; Wyborski, PaweÅ/HLX-6160-2023; Mrowinski, Pawel/P-1797-2018","Benyoucef, Mohamed/0000-0002-4756-3818; GaweÅczyk, MichaÅ/0000-0003-2299-140X; SmoÅka, Tristan/0000-0001-6196-4813; Wyborski, PaweÅ/0000-0003-4078-5343; Posmyk, Katarzyna/0000-0003-4655-5231; Wasiluk, Maja/0000-0002-6657-3827; Mikulicz, Monika/0000-0002-3930-4429; Mrowinski, Pawel/0000-0001-9931-7523; Musial, Anna/0000-0001-9602-8929; Zielinska, Agata/0000-0002-7568-5257",Foundation for Polish Science; EU; BMBF; DFG,Foundation for Polish Science(Foundation for Polish Science); EU(European Union (EU)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research was funded by the Foundation for Polish Science co-financed by the EU under the ERDF by a project entitled Quantum dot-based indistinguishable and entangled photon sources at telecom wavelengths carried out within the HOMING program.

QDs bear a huge potential for numerous applications thanks to their unique chemical and physical properties. However, stability and processability are essential for their successful use in these applications. Incorporating QDs into a tight and chemically robust ionic matrix is one possible approach to increase both their stability and processability. With the proposed liquid-liquid diffusion-assisted crystallization (LLDC), substantially accelerated ionic crystallization of the QDs is shown, reducing the crystallization time needed by one order of magnitude. This fast process allows to incorporate even the less stable colloids including initially oil-based ligand-exchanged QDs into salt matrices. Furthermore, in a modified two-step approach, the seed-mediated LLDC provides the ability to incorporate oil-based QDs directly into ionic matrices without a prior phase transfer. Finally, making use of their processability, a proof-of-concept white light emitting diode with LLDC-based mixed QD-salt films as an excellent color-conversion layer is demonstrated.

The solvation kinetics are biphasic, involving two transient intermediates. In contrast, Co2+ ions are doped much more isotropically in ZnS QDs, and this difference is attributed to the similar ionic radii of Co2+ and Zn2+ ions (0.74 Angstrom), as opposed to Cd2+ ions (0.97 Angstrom).

A record high eta(int) of typically 15% is obtained for a freestanding GaN crystal grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy on a GaN seed crystal synthesized by the ammonothermal method using an acidic mineralizer, when the excitation photon energy and power density were 3.81 eV and 60 W/cm(2), respectively.

The high structural quality of the ZnO/MgxZn1-xO MQWs is evidenced by the appearance of pronounced high order satellite peaks in X-ray crystal truncation rods; high resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images also confirmed the regularly arranged well and barrier layers. When the well width is less than similar to 2.7 nm, the quantum-confined Stark effect in MQWs can be negligible. Not only the increasing exciton-binding energy but also reducing exciton-phonon coupling determined in temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra indicate quantum-size effect.

Adenosine 5'-monophosphare (AMP) appears very promising for the stabilization and the further functionalization of QDs because AMP has multiple functionalities that can chelate metal cations. Herein, we synthesized high-quality CdTe/CdS core/shell nanostructures in aqueous media, in which AMP and thiopropionic acid (MPA) acting as dual stabilizing agents were introduced directly on the surface of QDs. With the combination of AMP and MPA ligands, it was found that dual ligands could accelerate the reaction kinetics, accompanied by possessing high emission efficiency of QDs. The prepared water-soluble AMP/MPA-QDs exhibit narrow size distribution and nearly spherical morphology. Most importantly, the resultant water-soluble AMP/MPA-QDs exhibit superior photo and colloidal stability, solving the problem of deterioration for biological applications.

Here, we report evidence for an even-denominator FQHS at nu = 1/4 in ultra-high-quality two-dimensional hole systems confined to modulation-doped GaAs quantum wells. We observe a deep minimum in the longitudinal resistance at nu = 1/4, superimposed on a highly insulating background, suggesting a close competition between the nu = 1/4 FQHS and the magnetic-field-induced, pinned Wigner solid states. Our experimental observations are consistent with the very recent theoretical calculations that predict that substantial Landau level mixing, caused by the large hole effective mass, can induce composite fermion pairing and lead to a non-Abelian FQHS at nu = 1/4.

There has been changes among the older persons in multiple dimensions that corresponds to quantity of life years lived as well as the quality of life. The existing multi-dimensional measures also consider the characteristics within a fixed old-age threshold framework which does not account for significant improvements in life expectancy over the years. We propose a new Multidimensional Old Age Threshold (MOAT) measure that accommodates different dimensions of quantity and quality of older persons. We achieve this through a modified framework of the Characteristic Approach. Our measure incorporates a forward-looking approach to measure ageing and specifies an old-age threshold for different countries after accounting for different dimensions of life expectancy, health and human capital. This method is more suitable for comparison across countries with distinct demographic and health achievements.

In fact, high computational cost can be the most important obstacle in WPPO problems. Population-based metaheuristics algorithms (PBMAs) are the most widely utilized ones for WPPO problems. However, these methods suffer from the issue that at each iteration, the minimum number of simulation run is at least equal to the population size. Knowing this, in order to enhance the efficiency of these methods, in this study, we introduced a cell-based quality gate function (CBQGF) which is inspired from quantum gates in quantum computing. The CBQGF is incorporated in our previously introduced inter-distance algorithm (IDC) which we called CBQG-IDC. Since, CBQG sets a condition for each location during the optimization process, locations with poor cell properties will be filtered out to increase the rate of convergence considerably. We applied the CBQG-IDC to two universally popular global optimization methods, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and compared the results to the IDC limited algorithm. In all scenarios, net present value (NPV) was considered as the fitness value and all joint optimization of locations and well associated parameters were conducted simultaneously. The results showed CBQG-IDC with a much higher rate of convergence compared to IDC, while its performance is highly dependent on constant parameters. Ultimately, the proposed CBQG-IDC can be applied to any optimization algorithm for any placement optimization problem in Euclidian geometry to save the computational cost.",Placement optimization; Quantum gate; Swarm intelligence; Global optimization; Reservoir simulation; Inter-distance algorithm,"[Semnani, Amir; Xu, Yungui] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Geosci & Technol, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China; [Ostadhassan, Mehdi] Northeast Petr Univ, Minist Educ, State Key Lab Continental Shale Hydrocarbon Accum, Daqing 163318, Peoples R China; [Ostadhassan, Mehdi] Univ Kiel, Inst Geosci Marine & Land Geomech & Geotecton, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Southwest Petroleum University; Northeast Petroleum University; University of Kiel,"Semnani, A (corresponding author), Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Geosci & Technol, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China.;Ostadhassan, M (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Geosci Marine & Land Geomech & Geotecton, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",asemnani@ut.ac.ir; mehdi.ostadhassan@nepu.edu.cn,"ostadhassan, mehdi/AAE-4941-2020","ostadhassan, mehdi/0000-0001-9235-4399; Xu, Yungui/0000-0001-7549-4832; Semnani, Amir/0000-0001-9451-3912",,,,,45,4,4,1,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-4105,1873-4715,,J PETROL SCI ENG,J.

In the QDs family, lead Halide Perovskites (HPs) QDs are especially recognized for excellent Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PLQY,70%similar to 100%),ambipolar carrier transport,wide color gamut (150% NTSC) and low-cost solution synthesis process,making them as promising materials for Light-Emitting Diodes(LEDs)toward high-performance lighting and displays. Compared to the organic- inorganic lead HPs (MAPbX(3) and FAPbX(3),X=Cl,Br and I),all-inorganic cesium-lead HPs(CsPbX3)possess relatively higher stability and comparable optical properties,are more promising to fabricate devices for practical application. Since the first LEDs using CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots(QDs) emitters,the PLQY and stability of QDs have been continually increasing. Despite the rapid improvement in terms of PLQY and stability,the mass synthesis of perovskites QDs has been seldom studied but very crucial for applications. In order to overcome the performance degradation of inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr3) QDs during materials preparation with large quantities, a modified supersaturated recrystallization solution- process was proposed to prepare high-quality CsPbBr3 QDs at room temperature. By adding hydrobromic acid(HBr) to accelerate the dissolution of the perovskite precursor,and introducing Lewis acid ligand to partially replace oleylamine(OAm),to realize the effective passivation of surface defect of CsPbBr3 QDs. This method enables the synthesis of highly efficient luminescent CsPbBr3 QDs with low cost and mass production. The experiment results show that the CsPbBr3 QDs exhibit an emission peak at 517 nm with a narrow Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)of 17 nm. Meanwhile,the PLQY of the CsPbBr3 QDs is measured to be as high as 95%. The X- Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbBr3 QDs show that its characteristic peaks located at 15.49 degrees(100),21.85 degrees(110),30.98 degrees(200),38.17 degrees(211),44.15 degrees(220),which indicated the typical monoclinic structure of the CsPbBr3 QDs (JCPDS No. 18-0364). The X- ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) implied the CsPbBr3 QDs showed Br- rich composition, which the rich Br in CsPbBr3 QDs probably contributes to the excellent optical properties and good air-stability properties in the ambient environment. As a proof-of-concept device,a backlit White Light Emitting- Diode(WLED)was fabricated based on the CsPbBr3 QDs. A mixture of the green CsPbBr3 QDs and commercially available red phosphor functioned as the downconverters,and separated high-energy GaN blue light sources for photoexcitation,applied to emit white light. Consequently,the WLED device shows a luminous efficacy of 48.35 lm/W under an operating current of 20 mA. Meanwhile,the WLED exhibited a typical Electroluminescence (EL) spectra which contain three emission peaks,454 nm peak of blue chip,517 nm peak of green CsPbBr3,and 620 nm peak of red phosphor,resperctively. Furthermore,we obtained the device with a CIE coordinate value of(0.30, 0.31) in CIE 1931 color space,which is quite close to the standard white color(0.33,0.33). The WLED with high efficiency demonstrated the promising potential of CsPbBr3 QDs for domestic lighting,backlit display,and optical communication applications.",Perovskite quantum dots; Solution-process at room temperature; Mass synthesis; WLED,"[Shen Yalong; Chen Peng; Hu Yinqian; Cui Lei] Suqian Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Suqian 223800, Peoples R China; [Shen Yalong; Wang Yue] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China",Suqian University; Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China.",shenyalong@njust.edu.cn; ywang@njust.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Research Program of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions [21KJB430011]; Suqian Sci Tech Program [K202126]; PhD Initiation Program of Suqian University [CK0004221]; Key Laboratory of High Performance Composite Materials of Suqian [M202109],Natural Science Research Program of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Suqian Sci Tech Program; PhD Initiation Program of Suqian University; Key Laboratory of High Performance Composite Materials of Suqian,"Natural Science Research Program of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (No. 21KJB430011), Suqian Sci & Tech Program (No. K202126), PhD Initiation Program of Suqian University (No. CK0004221),Key Laboratory of High Performance Composite Materials of Suqian (No. M202109)",,29,0,0,0,0,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",1004-4213,,,ACTA PHOTONICA SINIC,Acta Photonica Sinica,NOV,2023,52,11,,,,,,,1116002,10.3788/gzxb20235211.1116002,http://dx.doi.org/10.3788/gzxb20235211.1116002,,,8,Optics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Optics,IE1U9,,,,,2024-03-31,WOS:001164567600020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The similarity analyses of samples were evaluated by systematically quantified fingerprint method from the qualitative and quantitative perspectives, in which the macro qualitative similarity (Sm) and the macro quantitative similarity (Pm) were used to reflect the differences within samples. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences between the UV or FTIR spectral quantum fingerprints and their original spectra (t-test, P-value 0.05). The correlation of them was satisfactory (Pearson's r > 0.9220), which indicated that spectral quantum fingerprint had a good application prospect in the quantitative analyses and quality control of REYS. A fused evaluation strategy was developed in equal weights to avoid the unilaterality of a single analytical technique. The fusion results (Sm > 0.98, 91.9% < Pm < 106.6%) showed that 15 batches of samples were divided into grade 1 and grade 2, indicating good quality consistency. Furthermore, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay was applied to study the in vitro antioxidant activity of REYS samples using Vitamin C as the positive control, and the fingerprint-efficacy relationships of spectra and HPLC for REYS samples were explored respectively with bivariate correlation analysis to give out the three-dimensional active profiling.

To minimize the unwanted defects within the InP crystal, we explore multiple InAs/InP quantum dots as dislocation filters. The high quality InP buffer is thus obtained, and the dislocation filtering effects of the quantum dots are directly examined via both plan-view and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, along with room-temperature photoluminescence. The defect density on the InP surface was reduced to 3 x 10(8)/cm(2), providing an improved optical property of active photonic devices on Si substrates.

With increasing surface offcut angle towards [1 $(1) over bar $0] direction, the interaction of spiral growth around threading dislocations (TDs) with the offcut-induced atomic steps leads to a gradual change in the morphology of the AlSb buffer from one dominated by hillocks to that exhibiting near-parallel steps, and finally to a surface with increasing number of localized depressions. With the growth conditions used, the smoothest AlSb surface morphology was obtained for the offcut angles range of 0.8-1.3 degrees. On substrates with 0 degrees offcut, subsequent 3 repeats of Al0.24In0.76Sb/Al0.12In0.88Sb interlayers reduces the TD density of AlSb buffer by a factor of 10, while 70 times reduction in the surface density of TD-related hillocks is observed. The remaining hillocks have rectangular footprint and small facet angles with respect to GaAs (001) surface: 0.4 degrees towards [1 $(1) over bar $0] direction and 0.7 degrees towards [110] direction. Their triangular-shaped sidewalls with regularly spaced atomic steps show occasional extra step insertion sites, characteristic of TD outcrops. Many of the observed sidewalls are dislocation free and offer atomically smooth areas of up to 1 mu m(2), already suitable for high-quality InSb growth and subsequent top-down fabrication of InSb nanowires. It is proposed that the sidewalls of the remaining hillocks offer local vicinal surfaces with atomic step density optimal for suppression of TD-induced spiral growth, thus providing the important information on the exact substrate offcut needed to achieve large hillock-free and atomically smooth areas on AlInSb metamorphic buffers.

In this work, we provide molecular-level insights into the formation mechanism of biogenic QDs (Bio-QDs) and its connection with the cellular substrate metabolism in Escherichia coli. Strengthening the substrate metabolism for producing more reducing power was found to stimulate the production of several reduced thiol-containing proteins (including glutaredoxin and thioredoxin) that play key roles in Bio-QDs assembly. This effectively diverted the transformation route of the selenium (Se) and cadmium (Cd) metabolic from Cd-3(PO4)(2) formation to CdSxSe1-x QDs assembly, yielding fine-sized (2.0 +/- 0.4 nm), high-quality Bio-QDs with quantum yield (5.2%) and fluorescence lifetime (99.19 ns) far exceeding the existing counterparts. The underlying mechanisms of Bio-QDs crystallization and development were elucidated by density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulation. The resulting Bio-QDs were successfully used for bioimaging of cancer cells and tumor tissue of mice without extra modification.

Albumin is the most versatile carrier protein in plasma, possessing multiple functions; a reduced amount of albumin in the body is associated with different kinds of diseases such as hypovolemia and hypoproteinemia. The demand for albumin increased for various indications in shocks, burns, cardiopulmonary bypass, acute liver failure and research applications. Several potential problems associated with the preparation and administration of this substance arise from purity, sterilization process and vascular membrane permeability. The present review discusses the potential of metallic, quantum dots and carbon-based nanocarriers to improve the quality of blood products and the effect of these nanoparticles on albumin products. The effects of these nanoparticles on albumin products with a focus on toxicity aspects, structural alteration, stressing conditions, stabilizing agents and unwanted leakage are highlighted. Our literature review indicated the enhanced efficiency of AuNPs in metallic nanoparticles and better performance of negatively charged QDs on albumin products, which provided important information for possible safe use in medical applications. Moreover, among carbon-based nanoparticles, GO had relatively improved effects on albumin unwanted leakage and fibrillation.

Previously fabricated QD nanopillar arrays showed significant degradation of optical properties due to the etch damage. Here, a novel mass transport process in a Riber 3200 was performed to encapsulate the lithographically defined InGaAs disk QDs in a GaAs matrix, resulting in the passivation of the etch-damaged QD sidewall layer. Photoluminescence emission intensity following the mass transport process increased by a magnitude of 4-10 as compared to that from unprocessed nanopillar sample. In addition, a PL peak energy redshift was observed after mass transport, presumably due to the decrease in the lateral barrier potential from vacuum to GaAs, as well as the elimination of the depletion layer. Furthermore, the mass transport process in the high vacuum MBE environment enables GaAs overgrowth with few defects and dislocations following mass transport for surface planarization. PL emission intensity increased by an additional factor of 4 following GaAs overgrowth, bringing the QD intensity to 1/2 of that of the original single quantum well. Thus, the potential of the MBE-assisted mass transport process has been demonstrated to fabricate high optical quality InGaAs quantum dots encapsulated in a GaAs matrix for device applications.

In this paper, zero-dimensional (0D) MXene quantum dots (MQDs) with an average size of 2.7 nm are obtained through clipping step by step combining a chemical etching and a hydrothermal reaction, which display rich terminals (i.e.,-F, -OH,-O) and unique optical properties. The 0D MQDs incorporated into SnO2 electron transport layers (ETLs) of PSCs exhibit multifunction: 1) increasing the electrical conductivity of SnO2, 2) promoting better alignments of energy band positions at the perovskite/ETL interface, 3) improving the film quality of atop polycrystalline perovskite. Particularly, the MQDs not only tightly bond with the Sn atom for decreasing the defects of SnO2, but also interact with the Pb2+ of perovskite. As a result, the defect density of PSCs is significantly decreased from 5.21 x 1021 to 6.4 x 1020 cm-3, leading to enhanced charge transport and reduced nonradiative recombination.Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is substantially improved from 17.44% to 21.63% using the MQDs-SnO2 hybrid ETL compared with the SnO2 ETL. Besides, the stability of the MQDs-SnO2-based PSC is greatly enhanced, with only-4% degradation of the initial PCE after storage in ambient condition (25 degrees C, RH: 30-40%) for 1128 h, as compared to that of the reference device with a rapid degradation of-60% of initial PCE after 460 h. And MQDs-SnO2-based PSC also presents higher thermal stability than SnO2-based device with continuous heating for 248 h at 85 degrees C. The unique MQDs exhibited in this work might also find other exciting applications such as light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and fluorescent probes.",Perovskite solar cell; MXene quantum dot; Power conversion efficiency; Charge transport; Defect density; Nonradiative recombination,"[Nie, Junli; Niu, Bingqiang; Wang, Yijin; He, Zhang; Zhang, Xingmao; Zheng, HuanHuan; Lei, Yimin; Zhong, Peng] Xidian Univ, Sch Adv Mat & Nanotechnol, 266 Xinglong Sect Xifeng Rd, Xian 710126, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yimin; Zhong, Peng; Ma, Xiaohua] Xidian Univ, State Key Discipline Lab Wide Band Gap Semicond Te, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaohua] Xidian Univ, Sch Microelect, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xidian University; Xidian University; Xidian University,"Zhong, P (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, Sch Adv Mat & Nanotechnol, 266 Xinglong Sect Xifeng Rd, Xian 710126, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",pengzhong@xidian.edu.cn,"Zheng, Huanhuan/ISV-0894-2023; Ma, Xiaohua/M-6631-2015; LI, Jing/HNB-5575-2023",,"Wuhu and Xidian University special fund for industry -university -research cooperation [XWYCXY-012021020]; NATIONAL R & D PROGRAM of CHINA [2017YFA0207400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11604250, 62274130]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan of Shaanxi Province [2022JM-088]",Wuhu and Xidian University special fund for industry -university -research cooperation; NATIONAL R & D PROGRAM of CHINA; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Basic Research Plan of Shaanxi Province,"This work was financially supported by Wuhu and Xidian University special fund for industry -university -research cooperation under Project No. XWYCXY-012021020, NATIONAL R & D PROGRAM of CHINA under Grant No. 2017YFA0207400, National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 11604250, 62274130, and the Natural Science Basic Research Plan of Shaanxi Province under Grant No. 2022JM-088.

For example, a warm white shade is desirable for indoors, corresponding to correlated color temperatures <= 4000 K, together with color rendering indices >= 90. Additionally, the luminous efficacy of optical radiation (LER) should be high, preferably >= 380 lm/W-opt. Conventional white LEDs cannot currently satisfy these requirements simultaneously. On the other hand, color-conversion white LEDs (WLEDs) integrated with quantum dots (QDs) can simultaneously reach such high levels of photometric and colorimetric performance. However, their electrical efficiency performance and limits have been unknown. To understand their potential of luminous efficiency (lm/W-elect), we modeled and studied different QD-WLED architectures based on layered QD films and QD blends, all integrated on blue LED chips. The architecture of red, yellow and green emitting QD films (in this order from the chip outwards) is demonstrated to outperform the rest. In this case, for photometrically efficient spectra, the maximum achievable LE is predicted to be 327 lm/Welect. Using a state-of-the-art blue LED reported with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 81.3%, the overall WLED PCE is shown to be 69%.

Different precursor combinations of triethylgallium (TEGa), trimethylgallium (TMGa), trimethylaluminium (TMAl) and dimethylethylaminenalane (DMEAAl) were employed for growth of the Al0.30Ga0.70As barrier layer. Calculations of the 2D-Schrodinger-equation show, that suitable quantum wire geometries are obtained when using combinations with TMGa. High-quality material is achieved at 575 degreesC for TMGa/DMEAAl and 595 degreesC for TMGa/TMAl. In general, lower grow-th temperatures lead to the preferential lower radii of curvature for a given precursor combination.

In this paper, a novel strategy to obtain GQDs is proposed and demonstrated by an ion-beam assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Ion-beam irradiation provides catalyst sources for the GQD creation. The luminescent GQDs are generated using a Fe-implanted Si wafer by a two-step annealing process: i) A formation step of nano-sized Fe catalyst particles and ii) a synthesis step of GQDs by a CVD method. Under the 1st annealing step of the Fe-implanted Si wafer, Fe nano particles (FeNPs) are created by the diffusion and aggregation of Fe atoms. Due to the high temperature atmosphere in the 2nd annealing step, FeNPs are then completely removed, and thus only high-purity and-quality GQDs are finally produced. In our work, patterned GQDs were fabricated by using a metallic mask during the ion-beam irradiation. Furthermore, various GQD patterns were also demonstrated by combining the conventional semiconductor manufacturing process and our ion-beam assisted CVD technique. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Early methods for synthesizing InP QDs employed tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine and tris(dimethylamino)phosphine as phosphorus sources. However, the associated toxicity and hazards of these sources have hindered further progress. In this study, we introduce tripyrrolidine phosphine as a safe alternative phosphorus source. This source not only guarantees affordability, but also simplifies recycling and hazardous waste treatment processes. Simultaneously, precise regulation of the Zn precursor during the growth of the ZnS shell has enabled the synthesis of InP QDs of exceptional quality with a prominent emission peak at 525 nm, an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 76.11 %, and a narrow half-peak width of 37 nm. This achievement sets a significant precedent for the development of an environmentally friendly InP QD synthesis methodology. Furthermore, the incorporation of the QDs into white LEDs yields compelling outcomes, including color coordinates of (0.33, 0.30) and a measured correlated color temperature of 5637 K.

To scrutinize the root mechanism for degradation, several electro-optical measurements have been performed. The obtained results imply that (i) the rectification ratio diminishes largely after stress treatment, suggesting that leakage current and resistive effects are improved; (ii) both open-circuit voltage (VOC), and short-circuit current density (JSC) decline sharply within the first few hours (<50 h) of stress, after that degradation rates for VOC, and JSC slow down when stress time increases to 340 h, suggesting the physical processes responsible for degradation are altered after certain stress time; (iii) the spectral responsivity (R lambda), particularly at 384 (peak value) and below 347 nm reduce due to stress, indicating generation of deep levels associated with donors in n-GaN, and formation of severe point defects within MQWs lower the value of R lambda, whilst worsening of p-GaN quality ruin the detection capability below 347 nm; and (iv) the photo-response time changes due to acute carrier trapping during stress.

When spin relaxation occurs in the motional-narrowing regime, it remains constant over a large temperature range as the spin-precession frequency increases linearly with temperature, hence compensating for the observed decrease in the dephasing time.

This study aimed to improve its quality consistency evaluation method using fingerprint techniques from several aspects. First, the five-wavelength matched average fusion fingerprint (FMAFFP) for HPLC, electrochemical fingerprint (ECFP), and ultraviolet spectral quantum fingerprint (UVFP) was established for 22 samples, respectively. Their quality was then assessed using the average linear quantitative finger-print method, and 22 samples were classified into eight quality grades. OPLS and PCA were then used further to explore the characteristic parameters of these three fingerprints. Five compounds were quanti-fied simultaneously for the first time, and then the relationship between the average linear quantitative similarity (PL) and the sum of the five quantitative components (P5c) was investigated. A linear correlation r & GE; 0.9735) between PL and P5c suggested that PL may be used to predict chemical content. Finally, to investigate the antioxidant potential of the AOL, correlation analyses were performed for FMAFFP peaks-PEC and UVFP peaks-PEC, respectively, where the PEC value was defined as the quantitative similarity of ECFP. The Pearson correlation coefficient and gray correlation analysis were consistent, allowing us to initially explore the antioxidant capacity of the unidentified components of the samples.

Ag2Te quantum dots (QDs), with a relatively narrow band gap, show great promise for fluorescence emission at long wavelengths in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window for bioimaging. However, existing Ag2Te QDs have severely hindered the application of in vivo bioimaging due to their poor fluorescence brightness and stability, so it is important to prepare Ag2Te QDs with high quantum yield and stability as well as high biocompatibility in the NIR-II window. Herein, we designed an integrated method for the preparation of water-soluble Ag2Te QDs by mutual adaptation of QD synthesis and surface modification. We first synthesized high-quality Ag2Te QDs with different NIR-II emission wavelengths and the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) up to 6.51% by rapidly injecting the TBP-Te precursor into a hot solvent to form a highly fluorescent Ag2Te core. Then water-dispersible Ag2Te QDs were obtained by direct exchange of the hydrophobic Ag2Te QD surface ligands with thiol ligands. The PLQY of the water-soluble Ag2Te QDs obtained by this method can still be maintained at 4.94%. With these highly bright and stable Ag2Te QDs, the abdominal vessels, hindlimb arterial vessels, venous vessels, sacral lymph nodes, and tumor vessels were visualized non-invasively in vivo in the NIR-II window in mice. The results demonstrate that the integrated strategy of QD synthesis and modification provides valuable technical support for further in-depth applications of Ag2Te QDs.",Ag2Te QDs; thiol ligands; ligand-exchange strategy; NIR-II imaging; in vivo,"[Shi, Xue-Hui; Dai, Ying-Ying; Wang, Lei; Wang, Zhi-Gang; Liu, Shu-Lin] Nankai Univ, State Key Lab Med Chem Biol, Tianjin Key Lab Biosensing & Mol Recognit, Res Ctr Analyt Sci,Coll Chem, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xue-Hui; Dai, Ying-Ying; Wang, Lei; Wang, Zhi-Gang; Liu, Shu-Lin] Nankai Univ, Sch Med, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Nankai University,"Wang, ZG; Liu, SL (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, State Key Lab Med Chem Biol, Tianjin Key Lab Biosensing & Mol Recognit, Res Ctr Analyt Sci,Coll Chem, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZG; Liu, SL (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Sch Med, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",zhigwang@nankai.edu.cn; shulin.liu@nankai.edu.cn,"zhi-gang, Wang/IST-4441-2023; Liu, Shu-Lin/AEV-9470-2022","Liu, Shu-Lin/0000-0002-1043-4238; Wang, Zhi-Gang/0000-0002-3461-4014","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFA0210500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91859123, 21877102, 21977054, 91953107]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFA0210500), by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 91859123, 21877102, 21977054, and 91953107), and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

The alloyed quantum dots synthesized had good optical properties, the quantum yield was up to 25%, and the full width at half maximum of the emission spectrum peak was about 28 nm.

The strain is transferred by integrating free standing (Al)GaAs nanomembranes, containing QDs, onto piezoelectric actuators. Narrow excitonic emission lines as sharp as 25 mu eV are shown, and a tuning range larger than 5 nm is demonstrated. This range corresponds to an induced anisotropic biaxial strain of the order of 0.15%, as evaluated from the shift in the emission of the GaAs from the nanomembranes.

After development and validation of a complete spectral range (csr-) qHSQC assay, a specific pulse program with selective excitation was applied and the measuring time was reduced from 135 to 32 min, while maintaining the same resolution. This bs-qHSQC method (method I) showed slightly higher RSD values compared to the csr-qHSQC method (maximum RSD of 2.80%), but better recovery rates in comparison to the assay of the Pharmacopeia (97.3% for Aloe vera and 96.6% for Aloe ferox). Apart from quantifying the total anthranoid content, the method moreover allows the quantitation of aloin among other aloin derivatives, such as 7-hydroxyaloin, as well as the differentiation of the two investigated species. Additionally, a second bs-qHSQC method (method II) for the fast (4 min) determination of the aloin A/B ratio was developed and compared to C-13 qNMR measurements.

Three distinct dissociation processes are observed for the well-resolved hole cyclotron replicas (shake-up) of positive trions bound to neutral acceptors in the spin-doublet state (SU-A(0)X(d)(+)). To demonstrate that the hole involved in the shake-up process is not bound by the Coulomb interaction to the charged A(0)X(+) complex, we calculate the valence Landau levels using the Luttinger model beyond the axial approximation. The calculated value of the hole cyclotron energy agrees well with the experimental data for the energy separation of the A(0)X(+) and SU-A(0)X(+) lines, determined from the emission spectra. At low temperatures, below 6 K, the dominant dissociation results in a free hole and an exciton bound to the neutral acceptor in the spin-singlet or -triplet state, (A(0)X(d)(+) -> A(0)X(s) + h or A(0)X(t) + h). At higher temperatures, above 9 K, the dissociation into the free positive trion and the neutral acceptor (A(0)X(d)(+) -> A(0) + X+) predominates. From the temperature evolution of the integrated emission of the free trion lines (X+) we evaluate the transition energy between the two triplet trion states, the dark one (X-td(+)) and the bright one (X-tb(+)). The ionization energies of all detected dissociation processes are compared with the spectral positions of the relevant radiative recombination lines from which excellent quantitative agreement is achieved.",NEGATIVELY CHARGED EXCITONS; 2-DIMENSIONAL ELECTRON-GAS; CYCLOTRON-RESONANCE; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; GAAS; MAGNETOEXCITONS; SPECTROSCOPY; COMPLEXES,"[Bryja, L.; Jadczak, J.; Ryczko, K.; Kubisa, M.; Misiewicz, J.] Wroclaw Univ Technol, Dept Expt Phys, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland; [Wojs, A.] Wroclaw Univ Technol, Dept Theoret Phys, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland; [Liu, F.; Yakovlev, D.

The second group of plants was grown at 25 degrees C-RZT for 10 days before transferring to 38 degrees C-RZT for 10 days and then to 42 degrees C-RZT for another 16 days (primed). For the third group, plants were grown at 25 degrees C-RZT for 20 days and for the last 16 days were transferred to 42 degrees C-RZT (non-primed). RZ heat priming did not affect the leaf expansion of Arugula while the leaf expansion was slower in RZ heat primed Canasta compared to 25 degrees C-RZT plants. After transferring to 42 degrees C-RZT in the later stage, RZ heat primed Arugula had similar productivity but a larger root system with higher nutritional quality at harvest and during postharvest storage compared to those of 25 degrees C-RZT plants. After subjection to 42 degrees C-RZT, although RZ heat priming enhanced its nutritional quality, the productivity of Canasta was compromised.

In the present paper, we reviewed our recent application of our combinatorial computational chemistry approach to the design of new catalysts for high-quality transportation fuels. By using our combinatorial computational chemistry techniques, we succeeded to predict new catalysts for methanol synthesis and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Moreover, we have succeeded in the development of chemical reaction dynamics simulator based on our original tight-binding quantum chemical molecular dynamics method. This program realizes more than 5000 times acceleration compared to the regular first-principles molecular dynamics method. Electronic- and atomic-level information on the catalytic reaction dynamics at reaction temperatures significantly contributes the catalyst design and development.

The extensive use of microwave heating and the frequently suggested specific microwave effects, however, pose questions about the role of the electromagnetic field in both the formation and quality of the produced QDs. In this work a one-pot protocol for the tunable synthesis of monodisperse colloidal CdSe NCs using microwave dielectric heating under carefully controlled conditions is introduced. CdSe QDs are fabricated using selenium dioxide as a selenium precursor, 1-octadecene as a solvent and reducing agent, cadmium alkyl carboxylates or alkyl phosphonates as cadmium sources, 1,2-hexadecanediol to stabilize the cadmium complex and oleic acid to stabilize the resulting CdSe QDs. Utilizing the possibilities of microwave heating technology in combination with accurate online temperature control the influence of different reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, ramp and hold times, and the timing and duration of oleic acid addition have been carefully investigated. Optimum results were obtained by performing the reaction at 240 degrees C applying a 5 min ramp time, 2 min hold time before oleic acid addition, 90 s for oleic acid addition, and a 5 min hold time after oleic acid addition (8.5 min overall holding at 240 degrees C). By using different cadmium complexes in the microwave protocol CdSe QDs with a narrow size distribution can be obtained in different sizes ranging from 0.5-4 nm by simply changing the cadmium source. The QDs were characterized by TEM, HRTEM, UV-Vis, and photoluminescence methods and the size distribution was monitored by SAXS. Control experiments involving conventional conductive heating under otherwise identical conditions ensuring the same heating and cooling profiles, stirring rates, and reactor geometries demonstrate that the electromagnetic field has no influence on the generated CdSe QDs. The resulting CdSe NCs prepared using either conductive or microwave dielectric heating exhibited the same primary crystallite size, shape, quantum yield and size distribution regardless of the heating mode.",LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; SEMICONDUCTOR NANOCRYSTALS; SELENIDE NANOCRYSTALS; ALTERNATIVE ROUTES; CDTE NANOCRYSTALS; SILICON-CARBIDE; MONODISPERSE; SIZE; NANOPARTICLES; CHEMISTRY,"[Moghaddam, Mojtaba Mirhosseini; Baghbanzadeh, Mostafa; Kappe, C.

Si-based square microcavities with whispering-gallery-like modes have been proposed for optimizing their quality factors (Q factors). Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method is used to numerically analyze the optical mode characteristics. The influences of the side-length of the microcavity, the output waveguide width, and the etching depth on the optical modes of the microcavity are investigated in detail. It indicates that the Q factor increases with increasing etching depth, and decreases rapidly as the waveguide width increases. The results show that with the side length of 18 mu m, the waveguide width of 1.0 mu m, and the etching depth of 3.5 mu m, the Q factor is the highest, and the mode distribution is optimal. The mode wavelength and Q factor are 1305.9 nm and 4694.8, respectively.

The laser operates in pulsed mode with thermoelectric cooling. The detection is based on direct absorption in a compact 76-m multiple pass absorption cell. The laser is swept over a 0.5 cm(-1) spectral region containing multiple lines of both HCHO and HCOOH. Absolute concentrations are retrieved by simultaneous spectral fitting routines with a detection limit (2 sigma) for HCHO of 0.3 parts in 10 9 (ppbv) with an averaging time of 60 s under stable flight conditions. HCHO mixing ratios in the range from 0.3 to 5 ppb were encountered during flight conditions. Some of the highest mixing ratios of HCHO were observed over heavily vegetated areas of Florida during the test flights where the ratios of HCHO to methacrolein and methyl vinyl ketone, measured by proton transfer mass spectroscopy, are consistent with formaldehyde production by isoprene oxidation. The highest mixing ratios of HCOOH, up to 10 ppbv, were observed in an aged forest fire plume encountered over northern Canada, in which ratios of HCOOH/CO are greater than previous observations, while the ratios of HCHO/CO are less than previous reports from forest fire plumes. Observations of HCHO/CO and HCOOH/CO in urban plumes are indicative of a mixture of sources from direct emissions and secondary oxidation of anthropogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons.

Due to the outstanding photoluminescence (PL) properties of quantum dots (QDs), a high-quality CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDbased fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) aptasensor for simultaneously monitoring the amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta O) and tau protein was proposed. By engineering the interior inorganic structure and inorganic-organic interface, water-soluble dual-color CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs with a near-unity PL quantum yield (>90%) and mono-exponential PL decay dynamics were generated. The pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bond interaction between the aptamer-functionalized dual-color QDs and gold nanorods@polydopamine (Au NRs@PDA) nanoparticles resulted in significant fluorescence quenching of the QDs through FRET. Upon the incorporation of the APO and tau protein, the fluorescence recovery of the QDs-DNA/Au NRs@PDA assembly was attained, providing the possibility of simultaneously assaying the two types of AD core biomarkers. The lower detection limits of 50 pM for A beta O and 20 pM for the tau protein could be ascribed to the distinguishable and robust fluorescence of QDs and broad spectral absorption of Au NRs@PDA. The sensing strategy serves as a viable platform for the simultaneously monitoring of the core biomarkers for AD and other major diseases.",quantum dots; A beta oligomers; tau protein; simultaneous detection; aptasensor,"[Lu, Xingchang; Yi, Xinyao; Wang, Jianxiu] Cent South Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Hunan Prov Key Lab Micro & Nano Mat Interface Sci, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Hou, Xiaoqi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Hangzhou Inst Adv Study, 1 Sub Lane Xiangshan, Hangzhou 310024, Peoples R China; [Hou, Xiaoqi] Beihang Univ, Hangzhou Innovat Inst, Key Lab Intelligent Sensing Mat & Chip Integrat T, Hangzhou 310052, Peoples R China; [Tang, Hailin] SunYat Sen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Canc Med, Canc Ctr, State Key Lab Oncol South China, Guangzhou 510060, Peoples R China","Central South University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beihang University; Sun Yat Sen University; State Key Lab Oncology South China","Wang, JX (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Hunan Prov Key Lab Micro & Nano Mat Interface Sci, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.;Hou, XQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Hangzhou Inst Adv Study, 1 Sub Lane Xiangshan, Hangzhou 310024, Peoples R China.;Hou, XQ (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Hangzhou Innovat Inst, Key Lab Intelligent Sensing Mat & Chip Integrat T, Hangzhou 310052, Peoples R China.",houxiaoqi@ucas.ac.cn; jxiuwang@csu.edu.cn,"liu, feng/KCL-0778-2024; Tang, Hailin/AFJ-8662-2022","Tang, Hailin/0000-0002-3206-782X; wang, jianxiu/0000-0002-6344-6419","National Natural Science Foundation of China [22076221, 21876208, 22105011]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China for their financial support of this work (No. 22076221, 21876208, 22105011).",,61,8,8,24,73,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-4991,,NANOMATERIALS-BASEL,Nanomaterials,NOV,2022,12,22,,,,,,,4031,10.3390/nano12224031,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano12224031,,,14,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,6K6ID,36432316,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-31,WOS:000887602300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we chose thiol ligand N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) its the ideal stabilizer and have successfully employed it to synthesize high-quality NIR-emitting CdTe/CdS QDs in a one-step process via a simple hydrothermal route. NAC possesses favorable properties such as nontoxic, nonvolatile, inexpensive, and good water-solubility. Our as-prepared NIR-emitting CdTe/CdS QDs exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (45-62%), narrow full-width at half-maximum, and high photostability, thanks to the formation of a protective CdS shell on the CdTe core through the decomposition of NAC in the hydrothermal route under high temperature. The prepared QDs can be applied for bioimaging due to its excellent water-solubility and biological compatibility. The core/shell structure of the NIR-emitting CdTe/CdS QDs was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction, and X-ray powder diffraction.

However, the fluorescence intensity of the m-CDs is almost completely quenched as the pH is increased from 9 to 10.

Owing to the unique pH-responsive behavior, the m-CDs are used as a on-off fluorescent probe for water quality identification. By combining the reversible pH-ultrasensitive optical properties of the m-CDs in the pH range of 9-10 with the glucose oxidase-mimicking (GOx-mimicking) ability of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), glucose can be quantitatively detected.

The obtained aqueous CdxZn1-xSe and CdxZn1-xSe/ZnS QDs exhibit a tunable photoluminescence (PL) emission (from 433.5 nm to 501.2 nm) and a favorable narrow photoluminescence bandwidth [ full width at half maximum (FWHM): 30-42 nm].

These CdxZn1-xSe and CdxZn1-xSe/ZnS QDswere characterized by transmission electron microscopy,X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To further understand the alloying mechanism, the growth kinetics of CdxZn1-xSe were investigated through measuring the fluorescence spectra and X-ray diffraction spectra at different growth intervals. The results demonstrate that the inverted ZnSe/CdSe core/shell structure is formed initially after the injection of Cd2+. With further heating, the core/shell structured ZnSe/CdSe is transformed into alloyed CdxZn1-xSe QDs with the diffusion of Cd2+ into ZnSe matrices. With increasing the reaction temperature from 100 degrees C to 180 degrees C, the duration time of the alloying process decreases from 210 min to 20 min. In addition, the cytotoxicity of CdxZn1-xSe and CdxZn1-xSe/ZnS QDs were investigated. The results indicate that the as-prepared CdxZn1-xSe/ZnS QDs have low cytotoxicity, which makes them a promising probe for cell imaging.

These characteristics, along with their lead self-sequestration capability and easy-to-scale preparation, can enable breakthrough applications for CsPbBr3 QDs in the field of wide color gamut backlit display. A high-performance backlight white LEDs was fabricated using the CsPbBr3 QDs@glass powder and K2SiF6:Mn4+ red phosphor, which shows a color gamut of similar to 126% of the NTSC or 94% of the Rec. 2020 standards.",in situ growth; LED; CsPbBr3 quantum dots; transparent glasses; backlit displays,"[Li, Juqing; Fan, Yanhong; Zhang, Haoran; Li, Wei; Hu, Chaofan; Zhuang, Jianle] South China Agr Univ, Coll Mat & Energy, Key Lab Biobased Mat & Energy, Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Tongtong] Xiamen Univ, Coll Mat, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ru-Shi] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Chem, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lei, Bingfu; Liu, Yingliang; Zhang, Xuejie] South China Agr Univ, Coll Mat & Energy, Key Lab Biobased Mat & Energy, Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; Xiamen University; National Taipei University of Technology; South China Agricultural University,"Liu, RS (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Chem, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;Lei, BF; Liu, YL; Zhang, XJ (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Mat & Energy, Key Lab Biobased Mat & Energy, Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",rsliu@ntu.edu.tw; tleibf@scau.edu.cn; tliuyl@scau.edu.cn; zhangxuejie@scau.edu.cn,"zhang, haoran/JHS-7765-2023; Zhuang, Jianle/P-2723-2015; LIU, YING/GZL-7252-2022; Xuan, Tongtong/S-1062-2016; liu, ying/GXF-4294-2022; Liu, Ying/ISU-1216-2023; Hu, Chaofan/Y-8873-2019; Zhang, Xuejie/B-3433-2018; Zhang, Haoran/M-2665-2019; Liu, Ru-Shi/A-6796-2010; Bingfu, Lei/B-4421-2014","Zhuang, Jianle/0000-0002-4649-1939; Xuan, Tongtong/0000-0002-9176-7826; Zhang, Xuejie/0000-0002-4029-7000; Zhang, Haoran/0000-0002-4641-0641; Li, Yao/0000-0003-1930-0700; Liu, Ru-Shi/0000-0002-1291-9052; Bingfu, Lei/0000-0002-6634-0388; Hu, Chaofan/0000-0003-2311-8733","National Natural Science Foundations of China [51802101]; Guangzhou Science & Technology Project [202007020005, 202102020410]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2021A1515012613]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310217]; Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 109-2113-M-002-020-MY3]","National Natural Science Foundations of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangzhou Science & Technology Project; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (no. 51802101), the Guangzhou Science & Technology Project (Nos. 202007020005, 202102020410), the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (no. 2021A1515012613), and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (no. 2018A030310217).

In this work, it is found that the CdSe/ZnS QD's size matters for balancing their loading amount and quantum yields (QYs) in the DMSNs-QDs based label materials and ultimately determining the performance of LFIA. The impacts of three CdSe/ZnS QDs with diameters of 9.1, 10.5 and 11.7 nm on CdSe/ZnS QDs incorporation and LFIA applications are studied. The increase of CdSe/ZnS QDs size from 9.1 to 11.7 nm results in a decrease in CdSe/ZnS QDs loading amount and an increase in QYs of incorporated CdSe/ZnS QDs. This tradeoff leads to an optimized CdSe/ZnS QDs size of 10.5 nm, which exhibits the best LFIA performance due to the balanced QDs loading (2.26 g g(-1)) and QY (57.1%). The 10.5 nm CdSe/ZnS QDs incorporated DMSNs-QDs for C-reactive protein (CRP) detection achieved a limit of detection of 5 pg mL(-1) (equivalent to 4.2 x 10(-14) M) with naked eye, which is lower than literature reports and commercial LFIA products. This study demonstrates that the CdSe/ZnS QD's size matters for improving the quality of DMSNs-QDs and their LFIA performance for CRP determination, providing new insights into the rational design of advanced label materials for improving LFIA performance.",Quantum dots; Mesoporous; Nanoparticles; Lateral flow immunoassay; C-reactive protein,"[Gao, Fang; Lei, Chang; Song, Hao; Yang, Yannan; Yu, Chengzhong] Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Liu, Chao; Yao, Yining; Li, Shumin; Yuan, Ling; Wan, Jingjing; Yu, Chengzhong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Chem & Mol Engn, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",University of Queensland; East China Normal University,"Lei, C; Yu, CZ (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.lei1@uq.edu.au; c.yu@uq.edu.au,"Liu, Chao/CAF-2694-2022; wang, hang/JND-8481-2023; qi, qi/JWP-1757-2024; Song, Hao/C-5166-2019; Gao, Fang/GLT-6319-2022; Lei, Chang/E-1553-2018; Yu, Chengzhong/I-8663-2012","Liu, Chao/0000-0003-0316-4994; Song, Hao/0000-0002-6383-0605; Lei, Chang/0000-0002-6341-7677; Yang, Yannan/0000-0001-6696-3879; Yu, Chengzhong/0000-0003-3707-0785","ARC Linkage project; iMS Clinic (Zhejiang) Biological Technology Co.

The resultant nanowires (NWs), with a diameter of 200-250 nm, have an average length of 2 mu m. The feasibility of growing high-quality NWs with well-controlled indium composition MQW structure is demonstrated. These resultant NWs grown on Si(111) substrates were utilized for fabricating vertical-type light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The steep and intense photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra are observed, based on the strain-free NWs on Si(111) substrates. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis revealed that the MQW NWs are grown along the c-plane with uniform thickness. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of these NWs exhibited typical p-n junction LEDs and showed a sharp onset voltage at 2.75 V in the forward bias. The output power is linearly increased with increasing current. The result indicates that the pulsed MOCVD technique is an effective method to grow unialdal p-GaN/InxGa1-xN/GaN MQW/n-GaN NWs on Si(111), which is more advantageous than other growth techniques, such as molecular beam epitaxy.

As this relation fit various growth conditions, it provided a basis for a new parameter of effective TBAs concentration which represents the concentration of the tertiarybutylarsine (TBAs) effectively contributing to the growth of epitaxial layer. By using this new parameter, a large spatial variation of the efficiency of TBAs across a wafer in a direction of the gas flow was indicated for the growth of Ga(AI)As at low temperature of 500 degrees C. With using this parameter, the decomposition of 1,1-dimethylhydrazin (DMHy) was suggested to occur only on the wafer at this temperature. The optimized TBAs flow rate for the growth of GaInNAs deduced by considering the distribution of the effective TBAs concentration coincided with the optimized actual input TBAs flow rate. This coincidence supported the appropriateness of the method of measuring the efficiency of TBAs on the wafer with the effective TBAs concentration. The optimized TBAs flow rate obtained by using the new parameter was applied to the growth of a GaInNAs quantum well (QW) and to the fabrication of a high quality laser diode emitting at 1.21 mu m.

This follows from the vanishing of the quantum Hall effect plateau and of the corresponding minimum of the longitudinal magnetoresistance for a filling factor nu=1. Here positive magnetoresistance is observed, which is attributed to the presence of two types of holes with different mobilities. A quantitative analysis shows that these are mainly heavy holes having different mobilities in the sublayers that form. The difference of the mobilities indicates that the opposite heterointerfaces of the Ge layers are of different quality. It follows from an analysis of the shape of the quantum Hall effect plateau for nu=2 that the densities of holes in the sublayers formed are close and, consequently, that the profile of the potential wells is close to symmetric.
